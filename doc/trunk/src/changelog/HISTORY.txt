This file documents changes to the *Standard ML of New Jersey* system since
March of 2000 (around Version 110.26).  The change log  primarily covers
the compiler, the compilation manager (*CM*), the *MLRISC* library, and
the runtime system.  There are occasional entries about other components
(_e.g._, the *SML/NJ Library* and *ML-LPT*), but these components have
their own change logs that should be consulted.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
This change log is in ASCII doc format.  An HTML version of the
change log can be generated using the command

	make html

An entry should be made for _every_ commit to the repository.
The entries in this file will be used when creating the README
for new versions, so keep that in mind when writing the
description.

Also note that we now use Asciidoctor (asciidoctor.org) to process the
file, since the original Asciidoc is no longer under active development
and asciidoctor is also faster.
The structure of the HISTORY is that there is a section for
each release, which starts with a section header of the form

== Version xxx.yy; yyyy/mm/dd

The content of a section is a list of entries.  The form of an
entry should be:

    [yyy/mm/dd]::
    +
    Description ...
    +
    owner:URL[Your Name]

Note that we put "+" at the beginning of blank lines.  Entries are items
in a labeled list and the "+" character keeps eveything in the same list
element.

Here is a quick asciidoc cheat sheet:

    +					new paragraph
    *foo*				bold "foo"
    _foo_				italic "foo"
    `foo`				teletype "foo"
    http:/some.website.org/path[]	URL
    bugref:123[]			displays as "#123" with
					a link to the bug report.
    bugref:123[feature]			displays as "#123" with a
					link to the feature request.
    owner:url[name]			displays name with URL link.

Sub lists should be bracketed with lines containing just "--".
Bulleted list items start with a single dash or one to five
asterisks followed by some white space then some text. Numbered
list items begin one to five period characters, followed by
some white space then the item text.

Literal (verbatim) blocks are delimited by
.....................
   stuff
.....................

Superscripts and subscripts are denoted by putting ^ (or ~)
around the text to superscripted (superscripted).  For example,
the number 256 can be written as 2^8^.

SML source code displays can be included as source blocks:

[source,sml]
------------
structure Foo = struct val x = 1 end
------------

To process the file, you will need asciidoctor and the pygments.rb gem
installed.  See the Asciidoctor manual at https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual
for more information.

We have hijacked the "NOTE" admonition to mark updates to previous entries.
Use the following syntax for such updates:

[NOTE]

Here is an update to the entry
====

NOTE: the original HISTORY file was converted to ASCIIDOC using a Perl
script.  This script gets the basic structure for entries correct,
but there still needs to be a fair bit of editing to add ASCIIDOC
markup, fix indentation issues, nested lists, etc.  Working from most
recent to oldest, I've edited back to release 110.46 (2004/06/17).

[2022/07/22]::
+
Fix for {issue-base}/68[Unable to interrupt execution by using `SIGINT`].
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2022/07/06]::
+
Fixed some interfaces that did not agree with the **SML Basis Library**
specification.  Bugs bugref:318[] (`IEEEReal.decimal_approx` does not
match the Basis Library) and bugref:319[] (Type of `Real.fromDecimal`
does not match the Basis Library).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2022/07/05]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:316[] (`Real.fromManExp` does not return expected
value if `man = 0.0`).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2022/07/05]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:317[] (Conversion from string to real does not
accept non-finite values).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2022/06/29]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:314[] (`IEEEReal.float_class` does not match the
Basis Library).  For some reason, the `NAN` constructor took an argument
in our implementation.  This code was probably an early design of the
API that was changed in the Basis Library specification, but not in our
code.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2022/06/29]::
+
Fixed a pretty printing issue that arises when printing nested
structure definitions.  For example, opening the `OS` structure
in the REPL, would result in an extra newline between the colon
and the `sig` keyword.
This behavior is not present in the legacy version.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2022/06/27]::
+
Adding support for generating a SIG_GC signal when there is a garbage
collection.  I have also added a function
+
[source,sml]
------------
  val signalThreshold : int -> unit
------------
+
to the `SMLofNJ.Internals.GC` structure that allows one to specify the
threshold for generating a signal.  The default is `1`, which means
that for any major collection a signal is generated.  Setting the
threshold to `0` means that minor collections also generate signals,
while setting the value to something greater than `1` will filter out
collections of younger generations.  Collections that happen while a
`sigGC` handler is running are ignored, which should not be an issue
for thresholds of `1` or greater.
+
These changes fix bugs bugref:65[] (Garbage collection does not trigger
`sigGC`) and bugref:291[] (Signals are not delivered for corresponding
events).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2022/06/17]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:290[] (Incorrect pattern matching for exceptons).
The fix involves changes to `FLINT/opt/lcontract.sml` (function `swiInfo`)
and `FLINT/opt/fcontract.sml` (function fcSwitch). The contraction of
a SWITCH with an constructor as subject is suppressed when the
constructor is an exception constructor, because for exceptions comparison
using the conrep field is inaccurate when the constructor is defined
by an exception identity declaration (e.g., `exception B = A`).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~dbm[Dave MacQueen]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2022/06/05]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:314[] (`IEEEReal.setRoundingMode` is a no-op on Linux).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2022/06/05]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:312[] (`CM.make` is unable to handle filenames that
contain a backslash).  We have changed the semantics of paths given
to the functions in the `CM` structure to be interpreted using the
native pathname syntax (instead of *CM*'s generic syntax).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2022/06/01]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:284[] (Compiler bug: Contract: UsageMap on 132).
The problem was the the `CPSTrans.cpstrans` function was generating
code for loading spilled parameters in reverse order.  In addition
to fixing the bug, added some detailed documentation of the code.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2022/05/20]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:310[] (Error when REPL tries to print value of type
`Posix.FileSys.ST.stat`).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2022/05/10]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:306[] (`Word8VectorSlice`: mapping a subslice produces
wrong result or crashes SML/NJ).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2022/04/03]::
+
Fix a module compilation performance bug by removing `packStr` and
`packFct` from `Elaborator/modules/sigmatch.sml` (reducing the size of
that file by about 25%), and removing the call of `packStr`
(in function `constrStr`) in `Elaborator/elaborate/elabmod.sml`, replacing
it with a call to `Instantiate.instAbstr`. Goodbye at last to `packStr`!
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~dbm[Dave MacQueen]

//====================================================================
== Version 2021.1; 2021/12/31

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/12/31]::
+
Switched over to the *LLVM* version of the compiler.  Doing so has
two major consequences:
--
* The **MLRISC** code generator that we have used for over 25 years
  has been replaced with one based on the https:llvm.org[**LLVM Libraries**].
* We have dropped support for 32-bit systems.  Since we do not
  have a 64-bit Windows port yet, this version only supports "Unix"
  systems on the *AMD64* processor (we have tested *Linux* and
  *macOS).
  A 64-bit Windows version is a high priority and we hope to include
  it in the next release.
--
+
In addition, we have changed the version numbering scheme to a
`YYYY.NN` scheme, where `YYYY` is the year of the release and
`NN` is the release number for the year.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/12/07]::
+
Fixed a bug in the way that non-printable `char` values were being
printed in the REPL.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/11/23]::
+
Remove last traces of the lambda splitting support from CM.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/11/23]::
+
Changed the `Binfile` structure (and `BINFILE` signature) to support both
the old binfile format and a new format (both formats are documented in
the `dev-notes/binfile.adoc` file).  We are stiull using the old format,
but will be switching to the new format soon.  The new format has a more
structured header and removes the vestigial support for the FLINT lambda
pickles.
+
The new header format includes a proper version number, which should
make migrating to new binfile formats easier.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/11/07]::
+
Committed changes to fix bug bugref:281[] (Redundant error messages for when a constructor
name is misspelled).  Revision r7357.
--
* Modified `Absyn.value` datatype by adding an error constructor
  `ERRORid`.
* Revised `ElabData/staticenv/lookup.sml` to simplify and improve some
  functions (`lookVal` -> `lookIdPath`, `lookValSym` -> `lookIdSym`) and added
  a function `lookIdSymOp` that returns an option.
* Revised `pat_id` and deleted `makeAPPpat` in `ElabUtil`.
* Revised `elabPat` in `ElabCore`.
--
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~dbm[David MacQueen]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/11/07]::
+
Committed a massive set of changes from "merge/base" working directory
that contained manually merged changes from "newmc" into a fresh
checkout of the trunk. Base version of the trunk was r7349, which was
tagged to produce `$smlnj/sml/tags/pre-merge`. The merged trunk
version is r7352.
+
The changes include:
+
--
* A completely rewritten match compiler that transforms absyn to
  absyn. The old match compiler files in
  FLINT/trans have been deleted. The new match compiler is documented
  in `dev-notes/match-compiler/match-compiler.txt` (and successor documents).
  The match compiler code is in the new directory
  `base/compiler/Elaborator/matchcomp`. `FLINT/trans/translate.sml` and
  related files were also extensively revised to work with the new
  match compiler.
* PLAMBDA/FLINT types modules in `FLINT/kernel` have been revised so
  that the signatures of the main modules (`Lty`, `LtyKernel`, `LtyDef`,
  `LtyBasic`, `LtyExtern`) are all disjoint. Function and record metadata
  stuctures that were in the FLINT structure (`FLINT/flint/flint.sml`)
  have been moved to `kernel/funrecmeta.{sig,sml}`. This involved minor
  edits to virtually all files in FLINT and a few in CPS.
  See `dev-notes/FLINT` for further documentation.
* Bug bugref:294[] (Compiler bug: Recover) has been fixed by deleting a
  few lines of code in `FLINT/opt/fcontract.sml`. Files `opt/collect.sml`
  and `opt/fcontract.sml`  been "clarified" to make them somewhat
  easier to maintain/debug.
* The `VarCon:VARCON` structure defined in `ElabData/syntax/varcon.{sig,sml}`
  has been renamed Variable: VARIABLE (`ElabData/syntax/variable.{sig,sml}`),
  since it no longer contains functionality relating to data constructors.
* The regression tests (`$smlnj/tests`) were run and a few true
  regressions were fixed, including a type error
  (`bugs/tests/bug0573.sml`). Many regression failures remain that are
  due to differences in the pretty printers, reworded error messages,
  and new printing conventions for overload scheme type variables.
  Some reference test outputs were updated, but at some point all new
  outputs should be generated. But first, signature printing should
  be redesigned and reimplemented.

owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~dbm[David MacQueen]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/09/23]::
+
Changed the *binfile* representation to remove the pickling of
the *FLINT* intermediate representation.  The purpose of this
mechanism was to support cross-module inlining, but it has not
be enabled for many years.  Removing it is the first step toward
migrating the pickling infrastructure to use *ASDL*.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/09/23]::
+
Changed the way that versions are identified to allow a version suffix
(e.g., "-rc1" for "release candidate 1").  I removed the bump-release
mechanism, which might has served a similar purpose, but was restricted
to integer suffixes and has not been used in recent memory.  Also changed
the `SMLNJVersion` structure, which is generated by the `versiontool`.
The new interface supports the version suffix and includes both a build
date and a release date in the `version` information record.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.99.2; 2021/09/23

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/08/18]::
+
Fix a benign bug where the size of a floating-point spill record was twice
as large as necessary on 64-bit systems.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/08/10]::
+
Split out the `Real.toLargeInt` implementation into target-word-size
versions (the `Real64ToIntInf` module).  For 64-bit targets, the new
version uses the bit representation of the real number to compute the
result.  The 32-bit version is the old code that uses floating-point
operations.  This change fixes bug bugref:279[] (`Real.toLargeInt` returns
zero for anything in range `[-512,512]`).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/04/29]::
+
In the translation from Absyn to PLambda, there was a function (`inlops`)
that was used to build the primop and type data structures for numeric
types.  This function was being called for every primitive operator,
even though its results only depended on the numeric type.  I added
a hash table to cache the results indexed numeric kind.  This change
speeds up the compiler by about 3% (__e.g.__, compiling the compiler
went from 58s to 55s on a MacBookPro with a 2.4GHz Intel i9 processor).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.99.1; 2021/04/12

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/04/10]::
+
Changed the *AMD64* frame layout to include a word to hold the
`Overflow` exception.  This value is used by the *LLVM* backend
to generate the exception for checked arithmetic operations.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/04/10]::
+
Added support for running *SML/NJ* on *M1* Macs via the *Rosetta2*
emulator.  The change is to identify the *arm* processor as *amd64*
in the `config/_arch-n-opsys` script.  Note that while the system
basically seems to work okay under rosetta, trying to run the `makeml`
command after having compiled the complier caused a crash.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/04/10]::
+
Some minor restructuring of the logic in the generic installer.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/03/25]::
+
Fixed a bug with how *FLINT* numeric types were being translated to *CPS*
types.  Specifically, types that were smaller than the default integer
size (_e.g._, `word8`) should have been marked as having a tagged
representation.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/02/12]::
+
Fix for bug bugref:280[] (110.99 `config/install.sh -64` fails on macOS 10.15.7).
I was unable to reproduce this problem, but after some investigation, it
appears that the problem was inconsistent build tools being picked up from
the user's path.  To protect against this issue, I made the paths to the
*ar* and *ranlib* tools absolute.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021/01/12]::
+
Fixed a serious performance bug in the implementation of the `CharBuffer`
and `MonoBuffer` structures.  Essentially, if one did not reserve sufficient
space for the contents, it could take quadratic time to fill the buffer.
We now grow the buffer by a factor of 1.5 of its current size, with an
upper bound on the extra growth of 256K.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.99; 2020/12/24

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/12/23]::
+
Changed the layout of the *SML* stack frame on the *AMD64*
architecture to make it compatible with the way that *LLVM*
spills registers.  Essentially, this just involved swapping
the order of the swap area and the ML stuff.  We took this opportunity,
however, to localize up the representation of this information in
the compiler.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/12/23]::
+
Changed the format of the "magic string" in the header of binfiles.
The new format is "__arch__``-``__version__", where the architecture
name is limited to at most seven bytes and the version is limited to
at most eight bytes.  The string is padded with spaces to a total
length of 16 bytes.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/12/22]::
+
Various pretty-printer bug fixes:
+
--
* bug bugref:274[] (Minor pretty printing glitch when printing
  structure specs)
* bug bugref:276[] (Missing option to control extra newlines in REPL)
* bug bugref:277[] (Excess white space when pretty printing a module
  signature)
--
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/12/19]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:254[] (`Real.fromLargeInt` produces negative results).
The problem was because the digit size for `IntInf.int` is only one bit
smaller than the default int and the scaling factor `rbase` was being
computed using the `InlineT.Real64.from_int` function (so `rbase`
ends up being negative). Thus it would return incorrect results
whenever the IntInf representation involved more than one digit.
This is a bug on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. The fix was to
switch to using `InlineT.Real64.from_int{32,64}` to convert `rbase`
and digits to real values.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/12/19]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:267[] (Returns an incorrect result for a calculation
on `Position.int` for 32-bit mode). The problem was that on 32-bit
machines, 64-bit division is implemented by the IntInf module with
the result then being converted to 64-bits. The conversion used did
not test for overflow in the result.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/10/13]::
+
Changed the semantics of the spans returned by *ml-ulex* so that the
second component of a span is the position of the rightmost character
in the token (instead of the character following the token).
Specifically, the span latexmath:[(p_1, p_2)] specifies the
latexmath:[p_2 - p_1 + 1] characters that start with the character at
position latexmath:[p_1] and run to latexmath:[p_2] (inclusive).
This change avoids a potential problem when the span of a token ends
at the last character in a file (when the input is spread across
multiple files).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/09/10]::
+
Simplified the *binfile* representation by removing the option of
having multiple code objects.  Many years ago, we would split the
code for a compilation unit into multiple independent functions
so that the garbage collector could reclaim code that was only
executed once (or was not referenced).  The actual splitting of
the code in the `CpsSplitFun` functor (`CPS/clos/cps-split.sml`)
was replaced by a dummy implementation at some point, so we have
not been generating multiple code objects for some time.  Therefore,
we have simplified the code generator to assume only one code
object and have changed the *binfile* import/export code to only
support a single code object per *binfile*.
+
Also made this change to the bootstrap loader (`kernel/boot.c`).
+

== Version 110.98.1; 2020/08/25

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/08/25]::
+
Reverted some of the pretty printing changes that were made in 110.98
to the 110.97 version (the renaming of `PrettyPrintNew` to `PrettyPrint`
and the directory reorganizations were unchanged).  These changes
fix bugs bugref:266[] (Pretty printing regression in SML/NJ 110.98),
bugref:268[] (Polymorphic Type Pretty Printing Regression), and
bugref:271[] (pretty printer regression for structure binding).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/08/02]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:269[] (`Word64.fromString` causes an `Overflow` for
greater than 2^32^-1).  This bug was the result of constants from the
32-bit version of the code not getting updated for the 64-bit version.
Scanning of both hexadecimal and octal representations of both integers
and words were affected.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/07/22]::
+
Added an additional lowering pass for the `STREQL` primop.  This
primop is generated to implement pattern matching against string
literals.  Previously it was unrolled in the *MLRISC* code generator,
but we now do the unrolling in *CPS*.  The reason for this change
is that implementing the unrolling in the *LLVM* code generator
would be complicated because of the need to introduce phi nodes
in one of the branches.
+
The unrolling in *CPS* is somewhat different from before in that
we now bake the literal string being tested into the equality tests.
+
Also changed the representation of the primop to include the string
being tested against and removed the `STRNEQ` primop.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

[2020/07/10]::

[2020/07/08]::
+
Fixes for structure and signature pretty printing problems that were
introduced in the extensive pretty printer/pretty printing
modifications around revision 6291.
+
Files affected include `ElabData/modules/ppmod.sml`,
`ElabData/types/pptype.sml`, `TopLevel/print/ppdec.sml`,
and ``Basics/print/pputil.``{``sig``,``sml``}.
+
The pretty printing for modules still seems quite fragile, so there
are likely to be more pretty printing problems to be fixed later. In
particular, pretty printing of functor and functor signature
declarations haven't been tested.

[2020/07/07]::
+
Added a new _lowering_ pass following *CPS* optimization, but before
closure conversion.  This pass includes the previous passes for
64-bit operations on 32-bit matchines and for conversions involving
`IntInf.int`.  It also adds lowering for `div` and `mod` to native
machine division (_i.e._, `quot` and `rem`) and for trapping conversions.
+
The purpose of this change is to simplify code generation in preparation
for migrating to a **LLVM**-based backend.

The `HTMLDev` structure in the pretty-printing library has been
moved into its own library (`pp-extras-lib.cm`) and renamed as

on `html-lib.cm`, which allowed us to remove all mention of
`html-lib.cm` from the compiler *CM* files.

Completed the removal of the trigonometry operators from the primops.

owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/07/01]::
+
Disabled the use of the hardware instructions for the basic trig
functions on the *x86*.  Doing so simplifies cross compilation
from non *x86* hosts and also paves the way to removing the operations
from the compiler's primitive operators.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/06/30]::
+
Improved the *CPS* contraction phase by adding strength-reduction
optimizations to `ContractPrim`.  These include recognizing when
multiplications and divisions by powers of 2 can be replaced by
shifts.  Previously, these sorts of optimizations were provided
by *MLRISC*, but we plan to simplify the *CPS* IR prior to code
generation by replacing `div` and `mod` operations with native
machine arithmetic, which would prevent *MLRISC* from making the
optimizations.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/05/16]::
+
The *MLRISC* instruction selector for the *x86* and *amd64* targets
erroneously assumed that the `idiv` instruction sets the `OF` (overflow)
condition code when dividing the largest negative number by ``~1``.
In fact, such a division operation traps, which is okay, because the
runtime system maps the trap to the `Overflow` exception.  Since the
check for overflow is unnecessary, it has been removed from the files
`MLRISC/amd64/mltree/amd64-gen.sml` and `MLRISC/x86/mltree/x86.sml`.
+
Note that *MLRISC*'s non-trapping signed division operations can
actually trap on overflow, but this was true before this change.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/05/16]::
+
Changed the semantics of the `--debug` command-line option for *ml-antlr*.
Previously this option replaced the actions with a print expression, but that
limited its usefulness because of type errors in the generated code.  The new
behavior is to preserve the existing actions and just add the printing code.
+

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/04/27]::
+
Added a pass to the elaborator that check for variables that are
bound, but never referenced.  This check can be controlled by
the `Control.Elab.unusedWarn` flag. Unused top-level variables
are not reported (unless they are bound in the local part of
a local declaration).
+
The check is currently disabled because of false positives
caused by a transformation in the type checker.  For example,
the following function declaration: +
+
[source,sml]
------------
fun foo n = let
      fun f x = g x - 1
      and g x = f x + 1
      in
	f n
      end;
------------
gets represented by the following `Absyn`: +
+
[source,sml]
------------
val foo = let
      val foo = (fn n => let
	      local
		val tmp = let
		      val rec f = (fn x => Int.- (g x,1))
			  and g = (fn x => Int.+ (f x,1))
		      in (f,g)
		      end
	      in
		val f = #1 tmp
		val g = #2 tmp
	      end
	    in f n
	    end)
      in foo
      end
------------
where the instance of `g` bound to `#2 tmp` is unused.  This transformation
is done by the `wrapRECdec` function.
The unused-variable implementation was influenced by
https://gist.github.com/jvanburen/2ef1a722fba13fc169b670ba6392da52[Jacob Van
Buren's patch for Version 110.82]. +

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2020/04/24]::
+
The `LambdaVar.lvar` type is represented as an integer; since the earliest
days of the compiler this representation has been concrete, which meant
that the type system was not able to provide any guarantees that `int`s and
`lvar`s were not being mixed up.  As of this change, `LambdaVar.lvar` is
now an abstract equality type (internally, it is still and `int`).
Some comments about the changes: +
+
--
 * The `LambdaVar` structure now includes substructures that implement
   hash tables (`LambdaVar.Tbl`), finite maps (`LambdaVar.Map`), and
   finite sets (`LambdaVar.Set`).

 * most of the changes involved replacing `IntHashTable`, `IntRedBlackSet`,
   `IntRedBlackMap` with the equivalent substructures that were added
    to the `LambdaVar` structure (_e.g._, `IntHashTable` ==> `LambdaVar.Tbl`).

 * there were a few place where debugging code assumed that lvars
   could be printed as integers.

 * the pickling code requires a mechanism to convert between integers and
   lvars; this is the one place where the abstraction is broken.

 * the worst abuse of the fact that the lvar type was `int` was in the
   code generator, where arithmetic was used to generate a unique negative
   number that could be used as a hash key, so that a given `lvar` could
   be mapped to two different labels.  I fixed this by using two tables.

      The "abstraction" declaration that these constructors

been merged into a single architecture property.  The effects of this
merge are as follows:

Added support for the **-64** flag to the `cmb-make` script in `base/system`.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/10/17]::
+
Renamed the `REAL` representation constructor to `Raw64`, which matches
what is going on in the runtime system.  Also renamed the `toReal` function
to `toReal64`.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/10/15]::
+
Updated the `SMLofNJ.SysInfo` structure by removing constructors from the
`oskind` datatype that correspond to obsolete systems.  Also added a
`getHostSize` function that returns the host architecture's native word
size in bits (__e.g.__, 32 or 64).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/10/13]::
+
Added the **-64** flag to the `testml` script in `base/system` and
to the `.run-sml` script.  Thus, one will be able to specify the
32-bit version of SML/NJ using the command **sml -32** and the
64-bit version using the command **sml -64**.  Currently, 32-bits
is the default, since the 64-bit system is unstable.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/10/13]::
+
Removed obsolete operating systems from the `SMLofNJ.SysInfo.os_kind`
datatype.  This change reduces the type to two constructors: `UNIX`
and `WIN32`.  Also added a function `getHostSize` to the `SysInfo`
structure, which returns the host word size in bits (*i.e.*, either
`32` or `64`).  The word size is now reported in the compiler's
banner message at startup.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/10/12]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:130[] (failure to raise `Bind` exception). Added
a function `refutable` to `ElabData/types/typesutil.{sig,sml}` and
used it to limit type generalization of val bindings in
`Elaborator/types/typecheck.sml`.
The fix does not deal properly with refutability of OR patterns, but
OR patterns in val bindings is a dubious feature.
+
This change also fixes bug bugref:188[] (Missing warning for
nonexhaustive valbind patterns), bug bugref:190[] (Unexpected exception
in SML/NJ with invalid list pattern match), and bugref:199[] (Compiler
bug in pretty printing of result).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~dbm[David MacQueen]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/10/04]::
+
Modified the **cmb-make** script to support passing compiler control
flags to the build command.  The flags should be specified after the
path to **sml** command (if it is given).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/10/04]::
+
Finished the implementation of the new literal bytecode engine.
There is a control flag (`Control.CG.newLiterals` that allows
switching between the old and new bytecodes).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/10/04]::
+
Fix for bug bugref:225[] (`Math.ln` giving erroneous answers on Windows).
The problem was an inconsistency in the way the Unix and Microsoft
assemblers interpreted the addressing mode for the `FLD` instruction.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/10/03]::
+
Clean up in the Basis Posix library code (both SML and runtime) to
be consistent about when the `SysWord.word` type is being used to
communicate information between SML code and the runtime system.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.93; 2019/09/05

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/09/04]::
+
Add support for specifying a 32 or 64-bit target as command-line option
to the `.arch-n-opsys` and `.link-sml` scripts.  The default size is
currently 32-bits, but that will change once 64-bit support is solid.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/09/03]::
+
Generalize code generation for conversions involving tagged integers/words,
where the size is _not_ the default integer size.  This situation only
occurred for `Word8.word` values on 32-bit targets, but also occurs for
32-bit values on 64-bit targets.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/09/02]::
+
Rewrote the expansion of the `INLLSHIFT`, `INLRSHIFTL`, and `INLRSHIFT`
primops (`compiler/FLINT/trans/transprim.sml`).  The expansion process
now correctly handles shift operations on types that are smaller than
the default tagged-integer size.  This change also allows the `Word8`
shift operations to be inlined.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/09/02]::
+
Fixed a bug in the constant folding of arithmetic-right-shift operations.
The sign was not getting extended for words when the most-significant-bit
was set.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/08/25]::
+
Fixed a bug in the `Real.toManExp` function (the exponent was off
by one, which meant that the mantissa was two times its expected
value).  This fix also fixes a problem in `Real.toLargeInt`, where
the function would go into an infinite loop in some cases.
+
[NOTE]
.2022/06/29
====
This change probably also fixed bug bugref:208[] (`Real.toManExp`
produces incorrect results in some cases).
====
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/08/24]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:173[] (`OS.Process.sleep` only works with whole numbers).
For systems that have finer-grain sleep function, such as the
`nanosleep`(2) system call, the `OS.Process.sleep` and `Posix.Process.sleep`
functions now support sub-second granularity.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/08/18]::
+
Restructured the CPS contraction phase to make the fusion of
integer/word conversions more uniform.  Also fixed a bug
where `Int32.fromLarge(Word32.toLargeInt 0wxffffffff)` would
return `~1` instead of raising `Overflow`.  The problem was
that `TEST(m,n) o COPY(n,p)` was getting fused to `COPY(m,p)`
when `m = p`, instead of `TRUNC(m,p)`.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/08/14]::
+
Int64 comparisons were not always correct, which lead to some positive
values being printed as negative numbers (basically when the sign
bit of the lower word was set).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/08/13]::
+
Added `Unsafe.IntInf` structure, which provides access to the
internal representation of the `IntInf.int` type.  Note that
this representation may change in the future.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/08/12]::

Fixed bug bugref:223[] (Incremental Build fails on Windows).  There was
a missing `CloseHandle()` when getting a file's timestamp.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.92; 2019/08/10

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/08/08]::
+
Changed `base/system/allcross` script to use `cmb-cross` script.
Also modified the `cmb-cross` script to build compressed tar
files, when given the `-z` option, and to clean up intermediate
files.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/07/16]::
+
Restructured the **amd64** machine-code generation implementation and
filled in many of the missing encodings.  It should be complete for
**SML/NJ** code generation, but needs more work to support the full set
of operations described in the `amd64.mdl` file.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/07/16]::
+
Some cleanup in the **x86** MLRISC backend.  Removed the `MULB`,
`MULW`, and `MULL` unsigned-multiplication instructions, since they
are not binary operations.  The `MULL` instruction is covered by
the `MULL1` constructor in the `multDivOp` datatype.  The same change
was applied to the **amd64** backend.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/07/15]::
+
Many changes to the **amd64** machine description:
+
--
* Removed the `PUSHB`, `PUSHW`, and `PUSHL` instructions, since the matching
   `POP` operations are not supported.
* Removed the `CALLQ` operation, since it is the same as `CALL`.
* Removed the `CLTD` and `CQTO` operations, since those names are just
   synonyms for `CDQ` and `CDO`.
* Replaced the `INTO` operation (which is not valid in 64-bit mode) with
   `INT of byte`.
--
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/07/13]::
+
New script for cross compiling to other architectures; the script
is still called `cmb-make`, but now supports target-specific
dependencies in the front-end (_i.e._, representation of numeric
types and endianess).  The cross compilation scheme was developed
by Matthias Blume and then encoded in a script.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/07/11]::
+
The runtime system now builds for the amd64 architecture.  Most of
the changes relate to the difference between the flat BIBOP on 32-bit
platforms and the two-level BIBOP on 64-bit platforms.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/07/09]::
+
Fix bug bugref:224[] (`Word64.fromLargeInt` fails).  The problem was
an incorrect record kind in `CPS/opt/infcnv.sml` (it was `RK_RECORD`
instead of `RK_RAWBLOCK`).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/07/08]::
+
Changed the `rep` datatype constructor `Word32` to `Raw`  (which
covers both 32 and 64-bit numbers on 32-bit platforms).  We now
check the length of the raw object when converting to an
concrete numeric type.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/06/28]::
+
Removed the use of runtime-type passing for polymorphic arrays.
The effect of this change is that code that uses the `Array.array`
type will be faster when the element type is **not** `real` (__e.g.__,
sorting an `Int32.int array` was 1.2 times faster), but
slower when the type is `real`.  Use the monomorphic type
`RealArray.array` for best performance on arrays of reals.

//====================================================================
== Version 110.91; 2019/06/20

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/06/20]::
+
We added a new primop, `REAL_TO_BITS` that casts a floating-point value to the
same-size word value.  This primop allows the Assembly.logb function to be
implemented in *SML*. +
+
We have also refactored the implementation of the `Math` structure to share
common code across the versions that are specialized for different levels of
hardware support.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/06/19]::
+
Rewrote the assembly code for the x86 and AMD64 targets.  Previously, there
were separate source files for Unix and Windows; these have been replaced
by a single common file (one for each architecture).  The `assyntax.h` file
has also been replaced by `x86-syntax.h`, which covers both the x86
and AMD64 on both UNIX and Windows. +
+
The `AMD64.prim.asm` file now compiles, although there are a few minor
issues that will have to be fixed once we have a working code generator.
We have also fixed a number of issues in the garbage collector related
to the use of the 2-level BIBOP on 64-bit targets.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/06/18]::
+
Some cleanup in the interval-timer code.  In keeping with the other
time-specific functions, I have switched the runtime-system API to
use unsigned 64-bit nanoseconds to specify time values.  I have also
added an implementation for `c-libs/smlnj-runtime/itick.c`, which
was missing.   Lastly, moved the Windows-specific file `win32-timers.c`
from `runtime/kernel` to `runtime/mach-dep`.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/06/16]::
+
Added 64-bit implementations of the target-specific **Basis Library**
modules in directory `Basis/Implementation/Target64Bit`.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/06/16]::
+
Added `PackWord64Big` and `PackWord64Little` structures to Basis Library.
Note that the implementation of these is target-specific.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/06/16]::

Added `bigEndian` flag to the `TARGET` signature.

//====================================================================
== Version 110.90; 2019/06/12

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/06/12]::
+
Fixed the Concurrent ML library to use 64-bit positions (both Unix
and Windows) versions.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/06/11]::
+
Moved the year offset from SML to the runtime system.  This change is
necessary because Windows uses 1601 as year 0, whereas UNIX uses 1900.
We have also switched to using unsigned 64-bit times in nanoseconds as
the interface between the Basis code and runtime system.  This change
is consistent with the other places where time values are communicated
between the runtime and SML code.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/06/07]::
+
Fixed a problem with CM's symbol filtering (see bug bugref:222[]).
+
The problem could manifest itself when a library `l2.cm` imported two
symbols `A` and `B` from `l1.cm` and then exported the same `A` but a
different `B` (which could have been defined in terms of the imported
`B`).  Moreover, for the problem to occur both `A` and `B` within
`l1.cm` must have come from the same SML source file.
+
With the above setup, when running
[source,sml]
------------
CM.make "l2.cm";
------------
it was possible that instead of seeing the new `A` defined within
`l2.cm` one would still see the original version that came from
`l1.cm`.
+
owner:people.cs.uchicago.edu/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/06/04]::
+
Various 64-bit porting changes to the **Windows** implementation of
the **Basis Library** and runtime system:
--
* Add a target-specific `Handle` structure to support the `HANDLE` type,
  which is a pointer-sized word value.
* Changes to support the use of 64-bit file positions.
* Replaced pairs of argumnents representing time values (seconds and
  microseconds) with a single 64-bit count of microseconds.
--
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/06/04]::
+
Implemented https://github.com/SMLFamily/BasisLibrary/wiki/2019-001-Correction-to-PRIM_IO[
Basis Library proposal 2019-001 (Correction to the PRIM_IO signature)].
This proposal changes the return type of the `avail` function in a reader to
be `Position.int option`, which is necessary to support large files.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/06/03]::
+
Added primop support (`PTR_TO_WORD` and `WORD_TO_PTR`) for the
`c_pointer` type that was added in 110.89.  These primops are
exposed in the new `InlineT.Pointer` structure.  We define a
`PointerImp` structure that is used inside the Basis implementation
and a `Unsafe.Pointer` structure that is visible to users.

owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.89; 2019/06/01

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/06/01]::
+
Switched the `Position` structure to be bound to `Int64` and updated
the runtime system to use 64-bit integers for file offsets and
time values (in nanoseconds).  This change fixes bugs bugref:33[]
(Overflow exception with inputLine function) and bugref:36[] (Can't
open very large file).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/06/01]::
+
Added abstract `c_pointer` type to the primitive types.  This type
will be used to represent runtime-system pointers (__e.g.__, the
`HANDLE` values in the Windows implementation).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/31]::
+
Removed makefiles and code for architectures and operating systems
that are no longer supported (__e.g.__, the DEC Alpha and HPPA
architectures).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/31]::
+
Switched the `FixedInt` and `LargeWord` structure aliases to be 64-bits
(__i.e.__, `FixedInt` is now bound to `Int64` and `LargeWord` is bound
to `Word64`).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/30]::
+
We are now assuming that we have at least **C99** support (for
practical purposes, this assumption is even true on Windows).
With this assumption, the allocation of small objects in the
runtime has been switched from macros to inline functions
(see `runtime/include/ml-objects.h`).  This change allows a
graceful handling of 32-bit integers, which are heap allocated
on 32-bit machines, but tagged on 64-bit machines.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/29]::
+
Fixed various bugs in the implementation of the `Word64` operations.
The addition and subtraction operators were using arithmetic right
shifts, instead of logical right shifts.  Also, the translation
of 64-bit shift operations was incorrect because of a typo in
the variable names.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/27]::
+
Created a simplified version of the `MLRiscGen` functor.  This version
of the functor, which is in the file `CodeGen/main/mlrisc-gen-fn.sml`
does not include the memory disambiguation and GC types code.  Since
the old version (`CodeGen/main/mlriscGen.sml`) did not use these
features by default, there should be no difference in the quality of
the generated code.
+
The purpose of this change is to remove unused code that has 32-bit
dependencies.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/25]::
+
Added contraction for unsigned `REM` and `NEG` operations in
`CPS/opt/contract-prim.sml`.

owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.88; 2019/05/15

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/15]::

Moved the `compiler/DEVNOTES` directory to the `dev-notes` tree
and renamed it `old-compiler-notes`.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/15]::
+
Added 64-bit versions of `NumFormat` and `NumScan`.  We use the 32-bit
version for numbers of 32-bits or less and the 64-bit versions for
numbers with up to 64 bits.  Thus, on 32-bit machines, the default
`int` and `word` types use `NumFormat32` and `NumScan32`, while on
64-bit machines they use `NumFormat64` and `NumScan64`.  This change
also required splitting out some common code into a `ScanUtil`
structure and also splitting out the scanning of real numbers into
the `ScanReal` structure (formatting of reals was already in its own
structure).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/15]::
+
Reimplemented the 64-bit `int` and `word` types to put them on a
(mostly) equal footing with the other precisions.  In this new implementation,
the basic types `int64` and `word64` are now `PRIMITIVE` (instead
of being `ABSTRACT` type represented by pairs of boxed 32-bit words).
Arithmetic and comparison operations on these types are represented as
primops and are preserved as such up to just before closure conversion.
At that point, the new `Num64Cnv` structure (`compiler/CPS/opt/numcnv.sml`)
is used to expand 64-bit operations and constants into 32-bit operations.
Most of the 64-bit primops are inline expanded, but multiplication and
division operations are converted to calls to library code from the
`CoreInt64` and `CoreWord64` modules (`system/smlnj/init`).
+
Because the type are primitive, we were able to change the runtime
representation to use packed records (`RK_RAWBLOCK`) to represent
them, which saves space and should also help with performance.
+
See the `dev-notes/num64.md` file for more details about the
implementation.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/09]::
+
Reorganized the Basis Library source files (`system/Basis`) to isolate
dependences on target word size.
+
In the `Basis/Implementation` directory, I created subdirectories
(__e.g.__, `Target32Bit`) to hold implementations that are specific
to the target.  These directories include a `bind-structs.sml` file
that replaces the many `bind-*.sml` files in `Basis/Implementation`.
+
In the `Basis/Exports` directory, I replaced the many individual
files (each with a single module renaming) with `bind-common.sml`
(for target-independent bindings) and a target-specific file
(either `bind-target-32-bit.sml` or `bind-target-64-bit.sml`).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/05]::
+
Some of the CPS optimization modules (`Expand` and `EtaSplit` were
written as functors over the machine spec, when, in fact, they never
reference their functor argument.  Therefore, they have been converted
to structures.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/04]::

We now use the `InlineT.identity` primop for `Fn.id`, so the compiler
can optimize it.

Made the `Char.chr` operator inline (a primop was added to support
this change in 110.86).

owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/03]::

Major renaming of the primitive operators in the `Inline` structure
(as described in `dev-notes/primop-list.md`).  Also cleaned up the
**Basis Library** implementation to remove most (but not all)
32-bit dependencies.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/03]::
+
Added cases to the top-level pretty printer to handle the new basic
types that were added in 110.86 (*e.g.*, `word8vector` and `chararray`).
Also changed the way that primitive types are handled to use a
table keyed by tycons, instead of a sequence of nested conditionals.

//====================================================================
== Version 110.86; 2019/05/02

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/01]::

Added `word8vector` and `chararray` to the primitive types that
the compiler knows about.  These will be used in the rewriting
of the `InlineT` structure.

owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/01]::

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/05/01]::

Added `Primop.INLCHR` to implement `Char.chr` as an inline function.
This change also required moving the definition of the `Chr`
exception to the `Core` module so that it is accessible to the
translate phase.  The inline version of Char.chr will be enabled
in the 110.87 release (we need the internal primop before we can
use it).

[2019/05/01]::
+
Major overhaul of the representation of primitive operators (both in
the `Primop` and `CPS.P` structures).  The primitive arithmetic and
comparison operations are now defined in the `ArithOps` structure
(`ElabData/prim/arithops.sml`).  There are three datatypes defined
in this module
+
--
* arithop -- integer arithmetic operations that may raise overflow
* pureop -- arithmetic operations that are pure
* cmpop -- comparison operations
--
+
These types are used in both the `Primop` and `CPS.P` modules,
which makes the translation between representations more direct.
+
Some details:
+
--
* inline division and modulo operations were added to the
  `Primop.primop` datatype; the expansion of these in
  the `TransPrim` module (`FLINT/trans/transprim.sml`)
  adds explicit checks for division by zero.
* the `FSGN` operator was added to the `Primop.primop` datatype,
  since the new `cmpop` datatype does not include it (the
  CPS IR already had FSGN as a separate `branch` constructor).
* unsigned comparison operations are now represented by using
  the `UINT` `numkind`, which is consistent with how they
  are represented in `CPS`.
* Renamed the primop `ROUND` to `REAL_TO_ROUND`.
* the encodings for operators were revised in the pickler, resulting
  in a more compact use of the numeric codes.

Some minor primop cleanup.

  Also, the fields are now called `from` and `to` (instead of `fromkind` and
  `tokind`) to be consistent with other conversion primops.
* Renamed `ABS` to `FABS`, since it is only used on floating-point numbers.
* Renamed the CPS primitive operator `ROUND` to `REAL_TO_INT` and the operator
  `REAL` to `INT_TO_REAL`.
* Renamed the `Primop.REAL` to `Primop.INT_TO_REAL` so that it is not confused
  with the other constructors named `REAL`.

map any arithmetic trap to `Overflow`.

[2019/04/21]::

Yet another attempt to get the implementation of `use` in the REPL
working in a sensible way.
+
With these changes, `use` should behave as follows.
If an invocation of `use` encounters
a compilation error (either in the initial file or in a nested
invocation of `use`), then the compiler error message will be
printed and the call to `use` will immediately return `()`.
If an invocation of `use` raises an exception during execution
of the compiled code (either in the initial file or in a nested
invocation of `use`), then the exception will be reported at
the top-level.  Any change to the global state or environment
that occurs before an error is encountered, will **not** be rolled
back.
+
Files specified as command-line arguments to the **sml** command
will be treated as if `use` was invoked on them.  If there is an
error, then the error will be reported and the **sml** command
will terminate with a non-zero exit status (at least on Unix).
+
This change fixes bugs bugref:193[], bugref:217[], and bugref:219[].
There is a connection between this change and bugref:183[], which

**Xcode** 10.1, which is Apple's development environment for **macOS 10.14
Mojave**, does not include the libraries needed to build 32-bit executables,
such as the SML/NJ runtime, although 32-bit programs will still run.
+
To support building on Mojave, I added a new Makefile (`mk.x86-darwin18`)
for the runtime system and modified the `config/install.sh`
script to use this makefile when necessary.  This new makefile expects
that the `MacOSX10.13.sdk` directory from **Xcode** 9 has been
copied into the **Xcode** 10 SDKs directory.  Note that updating **Xcode**
from the AppStore will likely remove the 10.13 SDK, so you should keep
a copy in a safe place.

Removed several unsupported primitive operators from the compiler.
In the CPS IR, these were `free`, `acclink`, `setpseudo`, `setmark`, and
`getpseudo`.  The pseudo-register operations were not supported in the
code generator, while the others were no-ops.  The corresponding
operators `GETPSEUDO`, `SETPSEUDO`, `SETMARK`, and `DISPOSE` were removed
from `ElabData/prim/primop.sml` and their bindings were removed from
`Semant/prim/primop-bindings.sml` and the `InlineT` and `Unsafe`
structures.
+
The `AllocProf` module in the compiler was also disabled, since it
relied on the pseudo registers for recording profile information at

Added `Target` module, which specifies the properties of the target
(__e.g.__, the size in bits of the default int type).  Reworked the
generation of the `InlineT` structure to be target specific.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2017/09/18]::
+
Removed FLINT primops (and their CPS counterparts) that are not
in the `InlineT` structure and, thus, are never used by the compiler.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2017/09/18]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:123[] (missing nonexhaustive bind warning). The `mkVBs`
function in `FLINT/trans/translate.sml` was adding a redundant default
rule by calling `ElabUtil.completeMatch` after a default rule had
already been explicitly added to the match for let bindings.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2017/09/18]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:183[] (status code returned by sml REPL).  This fix
restores the version 110.79 behavior of having `sml foo.sml` exit with
a non-zero status when there is a type-checking error in `foo.sml`.
It also cleans up the error messages associated with `use` when there
is a syntax error.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2017/08/28]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:185[] (Bring command line help text into parity with man page).
Added missing options (`@SMLversion` and `@SMLsuffix`) to the
help message that is printed for the command "`sml -h`".  Also
adjusted the order of options in the help message, and in the man
page, so that the orders match.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2017/08/12]::
+
Changed the way that we test for allocation-space addresses in minor GCs.
Instead of using the BIBOP, we now do a pointer range test.  On 32-bit
systems, this change results in a small (~0.13%) performance boost, but
we expect a bigger impact on 64-bit hardware, where the cost of BIBOP
probes will be higher and there are more registers available to hold
the nursery bounds.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2017/08/12]::
+
Fixed some issues in build-literals.c.  These were mostly false
positives in the assertions, but there was also a bug in the way
that the available space was tracked that could conceivably
result in a crash (but was very unlikely).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2017/05/17]::
+
Fixed a bug in the way that JSON string values were being printed.
The code previously assumed that C-style escaping will work, but
that is not true for "\'" (as well as for control and non-ASCII
characters).  The new implementation assumes that the string value
is UTF-8 and uses the "\\u" escape sequences for characters outside
the JSON escapes and printable ASCII characters.

[2017/02/09]::

Linux distributions are starting to require that the stack be marked
as non-executable in applications.  Because the runtime system includes
assembly code, this marking was not happening.  We've added `.section`
directives to the `PPC.prim.asm` and `X86.prim.asm` files as
per https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/GNU_stack_quickstart#Patching[].
Thanks to Daniel Moerner for reporting this issue and for providing

[2016/09/15]::

Further cleanup of the separation of FLINT from the front-end.
Eliminated all references to `ModulePropLists` (`module-plists.sml`) in
the front end and in pickling, and moved `module-plists` from
`Semant/modules` to `FLINT/trans`.  `ModulePropLists` is now only used
in `FLINT/trans/translate.sml`.

[2016/09/14]::
+
Eliminated dependency of `PlambdaType` from the front end by adding a
type `TKind.tkind` which is a simplified standin for `PlambdaType.tkind`
for use during elaboration. `TKind.tkind` values are translated on
demand to `PlambdaType.tkind` in `trans/transtypes.sml`. Types still has
a `tycpath` type but it is defined using `TKind.tkind` now. The new structure
`SigPropList` replaces `ModulePropLists`
(`Semant/modules/module-plists.sml`) for use in `instantiate.sml`.
`Instantiate` is now defined directly as a structure so the functor
application in `Semant/modules/instantiate.sml` no longer exists.

[2016/09/12]::
+
Fixed bug bugref:153[] (Enabling Successor ML features is delayed).
We now use a function `Control.setSuccML` to switch to/from *Successor ML*
mode in the REPL. The function resets the parser, so the next input will
be correctly parsed.  The `Control.succML` flag is no longer visibile
in the REPL.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2016/09/12]::

Fixed bug bugref:149[] (Datatype replication exposes hidden constructors).
Added boolean field `stripped` to DATATYPE variant of tyckind in
`compiler/ElabData/types/types.sml` with default value `false`.
`stripped` is set to true when a datatype is matched with a simple
`type` spec in signature matching, and datatypes with `stripped` set
to true are disallowed in datatype replications.

Partial fix for the noisy exception-stack traces on the `Error` exception.
The cases that are handled by this change are applying `use` to a non-existent

with
+
--------
$/basis-2004.cm

in your CM files.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015/09/28]::
+
New implementation of `Date` structure in the Basis, which fixes bugs
bugref:138[] (Incorrect behavior for `Date.fromTimeLocal`) and
bugref:139[] (`Date.date` is broken).  Note that some more thought should
be given to the correct semantics of `Date.date` when dealing with
offsets.  For example, should an offset of +23 hours produce the same
date as an offset of -1 hours?  Currently our implementation produces
different results (by a day) for these two situations.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2015/09/25]::
+
Implemented the changes for
https://github.com/SMLFamily/BasisLibrary/wiki/2015-003-Additional-operations-on-sequences[
Basis Library Proposal 2015-003].  This proposal added operations to
the following signatures:
+
[source,sml]
------------
signature ARRAY
signature LIST
signature LIST_PAIR
signature MONO_ARRAY
signature MONO_VECTOR
signature OPTION
signature STRING
signature TEXT
signature VECTOR
------------
+
and the following structures:
+
[source,sml]
------------
structure Array : ARRAY
structure CharArray : MONO_ARRAY
structure CharVector : MONO_VECTOR
structure List : LIST
structure ListPair : LIST_PAIR
structure Option : OPTION
structure Real64Array : MONO_ARRAY
structure Real64Vector : MONO_VECTOR
structure String : STRING
structure Text : TEXT
structure Vector : VECTOR
structure Word8Array : MONO_ARRAY
structure Word8Vector : MONO_VECTOR
------------
+
While it is very unlikely that these changes will break existing code, there are
a a couple scenarios in which the code might break.  Namely, when use of `open`
introduces conflicts and when user code implements one of the affected Basis Library
signatures.  Both of these examples occurred in the *SML/NJ* source code; the former
in the *ml-yacc* sources and the latter in the *MLRISC* sources.

[2015/05/27]::

Added support for *Successor ML* lexical extensions.  These can be enabled
using the command-line option `-Cparser.succ-ml=true` or by the assignment
+
[source,sml]
------------
Control.succML := true;
------------
+
at the REPL.  The extensions are as follows:
+
--
  - Underscore ("`_`") as a separator in numeric literals; __e.g.__, `123_456`,
    `0wxff_ff_ff_f3`, `123_456.1`, ...

  - end-of-line comments, which are denoted using `(*)`.  End-of-line comments
    properly nest into conventional block comments.  For example, the following
    block comment is well formed:
+
[source,sml]
------------
(*
fun f x = x (*) my identity function *)
*)
------------
+
  - binary literals for both integers and words; __e.g.__, `0b0101_1110`, or
    `0wb1101`.

== Version 110.78; 2014/12/24

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2014/12/19]::
+
Major revision of the machinery for overloading resolution for both
operators (vars) and literals, now using a common mechanism. This fixes
bug bugref:52[] by improving the error message when an overloaded
operator is inconsistent with its context. Updated 23 files, including
major changes in `overload.sml`, `types.sml`, `unify.sml`, `elabcore.sml`,
`typesutil.sml`. The overload declaration is still used in
`pervasives.sml`, where the order of the specified instances of an
ordering determines the default interpretation (_i.e._, the first one).
+
The `SCHEME` and `LITERAL` forms of tyvars are replaced by a new
`OVLD` form that tracks potential instantiations of the type of the
overloaded vars or literals.

owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~dbm[David MacQueen]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2014/12/18]::
+
Moved `base/NOTES/HISTORY` file to `doc/src/changelog/HISTORY.txt`

moved the `README` files from `base/READMES` to `doc/src/release-notes`.
These changes are part of a general effort to rationalize and improve
the documentation of the *SML/NJ* system.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2014/12/13]::

Preliminary cleanups before changes to overloading

Minor cleanup in `Elaborator/elaborate/elabcore` (function `elabOVERLOADdec`)
and in `ElabData/types/typesutil.sml` (function  `matchScheme`). Preparing for
a new method of handling type checking of overloaded operators. [Note
that there is no reason for the options field of `OVLDvar` to be a
reference -- it is never updated. Changing this requires corresponding
change in pickling.]
+
Also added an `etopdebugging` flag (`ElabControl`) for debugging in
`elabtop.sml`. Modified `elabcontrol.`{`sml`,`sig`} and
`elabtop.sml`. Also rearranged ast and absyn printing in `evalloop.sml`.

Linux.  The problem appears to be limited to large file systems that
have more than 2^32^ inodes.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2014/09/13]::

Added `%value` directive to *ml-antlr*; this addition improves the
error repair choices by allowing non-nullary tokens to be inserted
when making repairs.

== Version 110.77; 2014/08/22


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2014/08/21]::
+
Created new `doc` tree in *SML/NJ* repository.  Currently this
tree just holds the sources for UNIX-style manual pages for
the command-line tools (fixing bug bugref:35[]).  The documentation
is written using the http://asciidoc.org[ASCIIDOC] format.  Use
the following *svn* command to checkout a copy of the documentation tree:

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2014/08/19]::
+
Compiling the runtime system on *cygwin* was failing because the file
`exceptions.h` was missing.  It appears to have been part of previous
versions, so a version has been incorporated verbatim in the
file `runtime/mach-base/cygwin-fault.c` file (fixes bug bugref:125[]).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2014/08/19]::
+
Added the `actionToString'` and `repairToString'` functions
to the `AntlrRepair` structure.  These functions allow one to
specialize the printing of tokens based on whether they are
being added or deleted.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2014/08/17]::
+
Added patches to support `OpenBSD` on `PowerPC`.  The patches were
contributed by Jasper Lievisse Adriaanse (fixes bug bugref:124[]).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2014/08/17]::
+
Use `mkstemp` to implement `OS.FileSys.tmpName()` on systems that support
it (should be all modern versions of *Unix*).  This change fixes bug bugref:128[].
(Thanks to Johannes 5 Joemann).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2014/08/17]::
+
Fixed a bug in `IntInf.~>>`, which did not handle negative arguments
correctly (bug bugref:110[]).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2014/08/14]::
+
Fixed a problem in the CPS contraction phase.  An optimization that
eliminates construction of a record that already exists was not
checking that the existing record was the same record kind (bug bugref:119[]).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2014/07/28]::
+
Switch to using `MAP_ANONYMOUS` to allocate memory on Linux systems.
This change avoids problems when `"/dev"` does not support execute
permission (as seems to be the case with some versions of *Linux*
running on ChromeBooks; bug bugref:120[]).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2014/06/28]::
+
Fix for bug bugref:127[] (Crash on *Windows* with `OS.Process.system`).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2014/06/07]::
+
Fixed a long-standing bug in `Socket.recvVec`, which prevented the result
from being used in a string pattern match (thanks to Vesa Norrman
for the fix).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2014/05/01]::
+
Fixed minor issue in an error message; type variable name should be
printed with leading `'`.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2013/11/25]::
+
Added `PackWord`{`16`,`32`}{`Big`,`Little`} structures
to the `Unsafe` module.  This change makes the `UNSAFE` signature
closer to the http://mlton.org[*MLton*] version, although we
still need to add the `PackReal` structures.

code to the `mkWriter` code.
+
owner:www.lars.com[Lars Bergstrom]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2013/06/04]::
+
Fix bug bugref:111[] (`Socket.acceptNB` returns somewhat broken sockets).
The problem was that under Win32, sockets returned from `accept` inherit
their parents' non-blocking status, whereas on *UNIX* they are always
blocking.

owner:www.lars.com[Lars Bergstrom]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2013/05/20]::
+
Fix bug bugref:117[] (`BinIO.openAppend` raises `IO` on non-existent file).
We were opening the file for append if it existed but not creating it
if it did not exist.

owner:www.lars.com[Lars Bergstrom]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2013/05/02]::
+
Fix bug bugref:116[] (`Socket.sameDesc` raises `Match` exception).
The problem is that on Windows the `iodesc` datatype (defined in
`Basis/Implementation/Win32/pre-os.sml`) has both an `IODesc` constructor
and a `SockDesc` constructor.  Updated the code in `Win32/os-io.sml` to
handle the `SockDesc` constructor.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2012/09/21]::
+
Bug fix in *ml-antlr* to ensure that the generated `toString` function
for tokens is strictly legal *SML* code (_i.e._, non-printing characters
and *UTF8* multibyte sequences are properly escaped).
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2012/09/11]::
+
Added `getu` function to `ULexBuffer` as a way to improve *ml-ulex*
performance. This addition allows a fastpath for processing ASCII
characters, which improved lexer performance by 3-4%.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2012/08/02]::
+
Fixed bugs bugref:89[] and bugref:96[]: Build Failure with *Xcode 4.3*
Also removed build support for *MacOS X* pre-10.5 (Leopard) on *PPC* and
pre-10.6 (Snow Leopard) on Intel.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2012/02/05]::

Fixed bug bugref:88[].  The check for valid arcs on *Unix* systems now allows
any character other than slash or nul.

+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~dbm[Dave MacQueen]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2012/01/12]::
+
1. Change of `SourceMap` interface.
   related to fix of off-by-one error in lexer (committed earlier?),
   and cleanup of *noweb* code added by Norman Ramsey many years
   ago (but little used today).
+
2. Slight cleanup of match compiler, eliminating `compiler/FLINT/tempexpn.sml`
   file that  was part of unused implementation of pattern templates (pattern macros).
+
3. Modification of type checker to add "culprit tracking" for
   improved type error messages (printing of additional culprit
   information is controlled by `ElabControl.showTypeErrorCulprits`
   flag, default false, added in revision 3652).  The culprit tracking needs to be debugged
   and improved, and the presentation of the culprits needs to be done better.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2009/08/19]::
+
Fixed a bug in the register-spill generator that is part of the MLRISC
register allocator. The problem was that the code in `RASpillWithRenaming`
functor assumed incorrectly that dedicated registers would appear in
def/use information generated by `ClusterRA`. Thanks to Allen Leung for
helping with this bug.

owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~mrainey[Mike Rainey]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2009/07/09]::

== Version 110.65; 2007/06/07


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/06/06]::
+
--
* Aaron: fixed a number of bugs in *ml-ulex*.
* Matthias:
   ** added CM control `cm.force-tools`; this is false by default;
      when set to true, then tools like *ml-yacc*, *ml-lex*, *ml-ulex*, etc.
      will be forced to run regardless of whether or not their targets
      are up-to-date
   ** changed installer code so that `config/install.sh` will re-build
      heap images for all tools even if those heap images already existed
--
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/06/04]::
+
After Aaron Turon's bug fix for *ml-ulex* (handling the `^` character
in legacy mode), re-ran the lexer generator on all lex input files
and committed the results.
+
This should fix the problem with *ckit* and *nlffi* that was reported
by Vesa A. Norrman.

//====================================================================
== Version 110.64; 2007/05/31


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/05/31]::
+
3rd merge of base from primop-branch-3 into the trunk.
Additional bug fixes included:
+
 * `Timer.cpu_timer`, etc. type printing corrected (by making
     `Timer` have opaque sig constraint in `basis/Implementation/timer.sml`)
 * Infinite loop in FLINT (`tests/typing/tests/25.sml`) (fix by
     Stefan Monnier)
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~dbm[Dave MacQueen]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/05/31]::
+
Fixed some bugs in new Div code in `FLINT/trans/translate.sml`.
+
Also, changed the handling of "no core access":  When `translate.sml`
needs access to a core exception at a time when the core has not
been set up yet (this only happens when compiling `system/smlnj/init/`*),
then don't bother generating the corresponding tests.
+
The old scheme was to generate a bogus value to be used in place of
the exception.  Unfortunately, that confuses the plambda type checker.
Moreover, it does not do any good, because at runtime we don't expect
such an exception to be ever raised.  (The code in `system/smlnj/init/`*
has to be written very carefully with this in mind!)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/05/29]::
+
Added `FSQRT` instructions for the AMD64 code generator.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~mrainey[Mike Rainey]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/05/29]::
+
`FLINT/trans/translate.sml` now wraps all `DIV`/`MOD`/`QUOT`/`REM`
operations with an explicit test for zero division.  This should
fixe several regressions and makes it possible for downstream optimization
phases to treat these operations as "pure" when they are applied to unsigned
operands.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/05/29]::
+
Added the new MLRISC code generator for the AMD64.  This version,
in contrast to the previous one, uses SSE registers and instructions
for all floating-point computations.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~mrainey[Mike Rainey]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/05/29]::
+
A number of fixes related to the formatting of dates.  These include fixes
for bugs #1415 and #1416.  We also now correctly handle format characters that
lie outside the specified set.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/05/23]::
+
CMB (and CM) now automatically defines the CM "preprocessor" symbol
NO_PLUGINS during "makeml -rebuild" or when CM operates in "slave" mode.
+
  (In addition, CMB_REBUILD_MODE is defined for `makeml -rebuild`,
   CM_SLAVE_MODE is defined in attached slaves while running CM.make
   or CM.rebuild, and CMB_SLAVE_MODE is defined in attached slaves
   while running `CMB.make`.  The point is that the single symbol
   NO_PLUGINS is definde in all three cases.)
+
I changed the three locations within the sources that get compiled
during `CMB.make` where *ml-yacc* or *ml-lex* input is processed: When
NO_PLUGINS defined, then the use of the mlyacc and mllex tools
is bypassed.
+
When bootstrapping new versions of the compiler, there can be
situations where the plugin tools for *ml-yacc* and *ml-lex* (or *ml-ulex*)
are not available or otherwise not operational.  In this case one can
manually define the NO_PLUGINS symbol prior to running `CMB.make()`.  To
do so, the following command should be issued at the interactive
prompt:
+
[source,sml]
------------
   #set (CMB.symval "NO_PLUGINS") (SOME 1);
------------
+
A `CMB.make` with NO_PLUGINS defined relies on the existence of the
files that normally would be generated by *ml-yacc* and *ml-lex*.
(Copies of these files are in the repository.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/5/23]::
+
Second merge of base from `primop-branch-3` into the trunk.
Additional bug fixes included:
--
  * `Date.scan` and `Date.fromString` fixed;
  * Overloading resolution fixed and some type printing problems corrected.
--
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~dbm[Dave MacQueen]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/05/23]::
+
Changed the installation mechanism for CM tool plugins.  These are
just libaries and now get installed like ordinary libaries.
+
There are now a number of new installation targets that give some
fine-grain control over what classes and suffixes are known, and what
they will map to.
See `config/targets` for details.
+
The code that caused plugin installation as part of running a
tool's "build" script has been removed.  (The build script is for
building, not for installing.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/05/22]::
+
Added a boolean control named cm.tolerate-tool-failures (env. variable
name: CM_TOLERATE_TOOL_FAILURES).  The default is false and makes
CM fail if a shell tool reports a non-success exit status.  If
the control is set to true, then CM will press on after tool failures
in the event that the target files exist (even though they are
considered outdated).  Turning the control to true can be useful for
bootstrapping.
+

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/05/19]::
+
Merge of ml-lpt revisions for 110.64.
+
The name of several ml-lpt-lib modules has changed:
+
[grid="none",frame="none",width="50%",cols=">2,^1,<2"]
|===============================================
|  `Repair`		| => | `AntlrRepair`
|  `StreamPos`		| => | `AntlrStreamPos`
|  `ErrHandlerFn`	| => | `AntlrErrHandler`
|  `EBNF`		| => | `AntlrEBNF`
|===============================================
+
The *ml-antlr* specification format has changed: declarations such as
`%tokens` and nonterminal definitions can occur *multiple* times in the
same specification.  The semantics are such that each new declaration
extends the previous ones.  This does not apply to `%start` or `%name`,
of course.
+
Importing a grammar via `%import` now includes *all* declarations in from
the imported grammar, except for `%name`, `%entry`, and `%start`.  Tokens
and nonterminals can be dropped using the new `%dropping` clause of the
`%import` directive; the separate `%drop` and `%extend` have been removed.
+
We now allow optional type annotations on nonterminals, using the `%nonterms`
directive as in *ml-yacc*.
+
The `refcell` construct is now implemented using SML's regular reference
cells, so the `:==` and `!!` notation has been deprecated.
+
The *ml-antlr* tool now does much more checking of specifications, and
its error messages have been greatly improved.  Error repair for
generated parsers has been completely rewritten, and is now both
much faster and more accurate.
+
*ml-ulex* is now more lenient with escape codes (non-SML-standard
escape codes are now interpreted literally, so _e.g._, `\|` denotes "`|`").
Also, character classes may now include a "`-`" character at the beginning
as is standard in most other regexp tools.
+
All of these changes are documented in the user guide, which has
been updated and improved with this merge.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~adrassi[Aaron Turon]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/05/03]::
+
Merge of the primop3 branch (base) into the trunk to create 110.63.1.
Significant changes in FLINT and the front end, mostly having to do
with a reorganized system for handling primops.  Various bug fixes
and improvements in printing signatures.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[David MacQueen]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/05/02]::
+
Preliminary commit of large *ml-lpt* revisions (more to come for 110.64).
The *ml-antlr* specification format has changed: declarations such as
`%tokens` and nonterminal definitions can occur *multiple* times in the
same specification.  The semantics are such that each new declaration
extends the previous ones.  Grammar extension constructs have also
changed.  We now allow type annotations on nonterminals.  Finally,
the refcell construct is now implemented using SML's regular reference
cells, so the `:==` and `!!` notation has been deprecated.  All of these
changes will appear in the 110.64 user guide for *ml-lpt*.
+
The *ml-antlr* tool now does much more checking of specifications, and
its error messages have been greatly improved.  There has also been
some work on the error repair process for generated parsers, but this
will be further improved in 110.64.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~adrassi[Aaron Turon]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/04/24]::
+
More Basis fixes: The `Char.fromString` (_etc._) functions did not handle
the "`\uxxxx`" escape sequence.  There is still an outstanding bug with
`String.fromString` the tail is a format escape.  I added a comment to
this effect in `Basis/Implementation/string.sml`.
Thanks to Andreas Rossberg.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/04/24]::
+
Added `next` function to `Fifo` and `Queue` modules in the SML/NJ Library.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/04/23]::
+
More Basis fixes: `Time.fmt` dropped the leading "`~`" for negative time
values that had no whole part.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/04/23]::
+
More Basis fixes: the `OS.Path` module did not include the `InvalidArc`
exception and did not do sufficient argument checking.
Thanks to Stephen Weeks and Adam Chilpala.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/04/16]::
+
Fixed an unbound functor bug in the AMD64 CM file.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~mrainey[Mike Rainey]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/04/12]::
+
Substantially changed the signature and implementation of AMD64
SVID.  It now looks similar to the ia32 SVID, yet uses staged
allocation.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~mrainey[Mike Rainey]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/04/07]::
+
More Basis fixes: the `WORD` signature was missing {`to`,`from`}`Large.`
Thanks to Andreas Rossberg.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.63; 2007/03/22


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/03/19]::
+
Fixed bogus operand sizes in AMD64 instruction spilling.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~mrainey[Mike Rainey]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/03/19]::
+
Fixed a number of inconsistencies between the `Posix.TTY` structure
and the Basis specification.  Thanks to Adam Chilpala.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/02/26]::
+
Added preliminary support in MLRISC for Staged Allocation, a technique
for specifying calling conventions (see
`http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/pubs/staged-abstract.html`).
Initially, we plan to use this code to generate C calls for the AMD64.
+
The staged allocation code base resides in `MLRISC/staged-allocation`,
and specialized calling conventions go in `MLRISC/ARCH/staged-allocation`.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~mrainey[Mike Rainey]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/02/20]::
+
Bug fix: when `SaveCState` was called with two values to save, a subsequent
GC could cause the `RestoreCState` to fail because the saved state had been
promoted to tagless pair.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/02/20]::
+
Fixed bug triggered by:
+
[source,sml]
------------
    val a1 = Word8Array.array(a1, 0w0);
    val _  = Word8Array.update(a1, 0, 0w128);
------------
+
The `x86MCEmitter` crashed when the immediate operand to `MOVB` was outside
of the range `-128` ... `127`.  I've changed the code so that the range
check is disabled.   Only the low order 8 bits of the immediate operand
are now significant.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/02/15]::
+
Eliminated any mention of *lexgen*, which was an early precursor
to *ml-ulex*.
+
You should update your admin directory, so the shell scripts for
maintaining your local copy of the repository reflect this change.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/02/14]::
+
Fixed bug in CM's parallel make facility that failed to have
the master re-link modules after letting slaves compile them.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/02/12]::
+
Fixed typo in *ml-build* script that prevented library anchors
from being registered.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.62; 2007/02/02


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/01/31]::
+
Brought ml-lpt manual up-to-date with the code.  Many minor
improvements to the tools, and a few minor bugfixes.  Prepared
ml-lpt-lib for integration with new `UTF8` structure.  Changed
the interface for creating streams in *ml-ulex* (we now support
stream creation from several kinds of sources).  Overall, the
tools are now quite stable, and their interfaces are unlikely to
change in a way that would break compatibility.  More work,
however, is needed in the documentation.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~adrassi[Aaron Turon]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/02/01]::
+
Implemented library installer.  Moved CM plugin code for
*ml-burg*, *ml-lex*, and *ml-yacc* out of CM source tree and into
their respective trees.  Implemented CM plugin for *ml-ulex*
and *ml-antlr*.  Used library installer for *ml-burg*, *ml-ulex*,
and *ml-antlr*.
+
For *ml-yacc* and *ml-lex* we continue to have permanently "plugged-in"
CM tools.  (It turns out to be too messy to do otherwise because
there is too much code that during installation relies on the presence
of these tools -- resulting in a tricky ordering problem.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/01/30]::
+
Added `SMLofNJ.shiftArgs` which is like a shell's "shift" command.
Modified CM's startup code to use `shiftArgs` as it processes
command line arguments.  This way, the init code in each .sml-file
or library that is mentioned at the top level will see only
those arguments that have not yet been processed at this point.
In other words, the init code can "seize control" and process the
remaining command line.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/01/30]::
+
Added fromList function to the `ORD_SET` interface and lookup to the
`ORD_MAP` interface.  See the SML/NJ Library CHANGES file for details.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/01/28]::
+
Added the `UTF8` structure and signature from the Moby compiler to
the SML/NJ library (and the CML library).  These modules will replace
the version in the ml-lpt-lib.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2007/01/26]::
+
Added entries to handle ml-lpt-lib.cm in installer.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.61.1; 2006/12/15


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/12/15]::
+
Fixed brown-paper-bag bug with CM's pathname handling, which made
installation fail under *Win32*.
+
This supersedes the pre-brown-paper-bug release (see below).
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.61; 2006/12/14


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/14/06]::
+
Fixed the code in `runtime/c-libs/posix-tty/`{`tcgetattr`,`tcsetattr`}`.c` to
get the c_cc termios data copied correctly.  Also moved the allocation
of the string to avoid problems if it caused a GC.
+
Thanks to Timothy Bourke for the bug report and fix.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/12/08]::
+
Added code to CM's "standard shell tool" implementation which
causes it to tolerate (with a warning) the situation where the shell
command fails (_e.g._, due to the shell command's non-existence)
as long as all target files exist.
+
This makes it possible to, _e.g._, build *ml-yacc* from sources even if
svn checkout messed up the time stamps on files in such a way that
`yacc.grm` is younger than yacc.grm.sml or `yacc.grm.sig`.  (*Ml-yacc*
would be needed to re-process `yacc.grm`, but obviously it might not yet be
available at that time.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/12/06]::
+
Fixed the types of `recvVecFrom`, `recvVecFrom'`, `recvVecFromNB`, and
`recvVecFromNB'` in the `SOCKET` signature.  This error is actually
in the _SML Basis_ specification too.
+
owner:cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/12/05]::
+
CM now reports undefined anchors as errors and aborts execution
rather than silently pressing on using bogus values.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/11/29]::
+
Use `Say.vsay` for printing the "`[autoloading]`" message, so
`#set CM.Control.verbose false` (or `-Ccm.verbose=false`) can be used
to suppress them.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/11/10]::
+
Fixed bug in CM where "`with:`" specifications that affect compilation
(as opposed to parsing) were ignored.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//====================================================================

|===========================================================
+
(All pathnames are relative to the SML/NJ "root" directory.)
+
In addition, there is also a new
+
...........
  ml-lpt
...........
+
directory containing two new program generator tools: *ml-ulex* and
*ml-antlr* (a lexer generator that handles unicode and an ANTRL-inspired
LL(k) parser generator). These tools are currently "beta-quality"
+
The latest versios of the sources can now be obtained anonymously
via subversion.  For this, it is useful to first check out
+
...........
  svn://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/smlnj/admin
...........
+
and put the resulting directory on your shell's PATH.  This provides
access to three shell scripts: checkout-all.sh, stat-all.sh,
and refresh-all.sh.
+
To create a freshly checked-out copy of the sources, do
+
...........
  checkout-all.sh [dir]
...........
+
where dir is the optional SML/NJ root directory (default is ".").
+
This creates the above directory layout.  Each subdirectory of
the root is under individual subversion control.  The stat-all.sh
and refresh-al.sh scripts apply "svn stat" or "svn update" to
each of these subtrees.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/11/02]::
+
Reorganized directory layout.
+
This is a temporary solution, more reorganization is to come.
+
The basic idea is to have a number of toplevel trees, each corresponding
to a well-defined part of the overall system.  Each part can be
maintained individually, even in separate source repositories,
although currently we still serve everything out of the main
smlnj-gforge tree.
+
Installer and and scripts have been updated to reflect the new
layout.  The installer (base/src/system/smlnj/installer) is now
"scriptable" to avoid burning too much knowledge about the
layout into SML source code.  The main script used by the installer
is in config/actions.
+
The main change is that many of the subdirectories of what used to
be known as "src" have moved to the toplevel.  The "src" directory
itself has moved down into a subtree called "base".  (We may eventually
get rid of the extra level of indirection represented by "src".)
+
The layout is now as follows:
+
[frame="none",width="90%",cols="<2,<3",options="header"]
|===========================================================
| toplevel tree name | default repository
                       (using `svn://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/smlnj` for `$gf`)
+
| `config`	     | `$gf/config/trunk`
+
| `base`             | `$gf/sml/trunk`
+
| `smlnj-lib`	     | `$gf/smlnj-lib/trunk`
| `MLRISC`           | `$gf/MLRISC/trunk`
+
| `ml-yacc`	     | `$gf/ml-yacc/trunk`
| `ml-lex`	     | `$gf/ml-lex/trunk`
| `ml-burg`	     | `$gf/ml-burg/trunk`
| `lexgen`	     | `$gf/lexgen/trunk`
| `heap2asm`	     | `$gf/heap2asm/trunk`
+
| `cml`              | `$gf/cml/trunk`
| `eXene`            | `$gf/eXene/trunk`
| `ckit`	     | `$gf/ckit/trunk`
| `nlffi`            | `$gf/nlffi/trunk`
+
| `smlnj-c`	     | `$gf/smlnj-c/trunk`
|===========================================================
+
In `$gf/admin` there are a few useful shell scripts for checking out
and maintaining the entire collection of trees:
+
--
`admin/checkout-all.sh` [__dir__]::
+
optionally creates _dir_ and checks out all trees from their
default repositories; if _dir_ is missing, checkout into the
current working directory.
+
`admin/refresh-all.sh` [__dir__]::
looks at all trees (from the above list) in _dir_ (default: .)
and runs "`svn update`" if the tree exists and is under
subversion control;
non-existing or non-subversion trees are skipped
+
`admin/stat-all.sh` [__dir__]::
like `refresh-all.sh`, but runs "`svn stat`" instead

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/10/05]::

Merged code for AMD64 backend (Mike Rainey's work).
Everything is hooked up but untested.

//====================================================================
== Version 110.59; 2006/05/17


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/05/17]::
+
I am freezing 110.59.  Changes other than the version-number increase:
+
--
eXene::
+
committed changes to eXene from Alley Stoughton:
"fixed bugs in X authorization and resource handling, as well
 as in the pile and viewport widgets"
+
Runtime::
+
fixed linking problem with *NetBSD 3.x*.
+
Lexgen::
+
    * *lexgen* tool handles non-ascii characters in 7-bit mode the same
      way that *ml-lex* does
+
    * lexgen propagates exceptions the same way that *ml-lex* does
+
CML::
+
Fixed a bug in the `SyncVar` polling functions (`iGetPoll`,
`mTakePoll`, and `mGetPoll`) that could lead to livelock.
--
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/05/12]::
+
Implemented *ml-makedepend* (_i.e._, CM.sources) in a better (more robust)
way.  This should hopefully fix the *ml-makedepend* problem permanently.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/05/12]::
+
Fixed long-standing bug with *ml-makedepend* where it would output a
spurious dependency to a non-existing file.  (This is a simple fix.
It might need further looking into.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/04/20]::
+
Committed patches received from Johannes 5 Joemann (joemann@befree.free.de)
that enable *heap2exec* under `Linux` and `FreeBSD`.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/04/14]::
+
MLRISC changes:
+
--
. renamed `GAS_PSEUDO_OPS` to `AS_PSEUDO_OPS` and put it in its own file.
. added support for `NOTB` and `XORB` operators in pseudo-op expressions
. added `DarwinPseudoOp` functor that supports Darwin's assembler syntax.
. added support for 64-bit integer literals
--
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.58; 2006/03/03


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/03/01]::
+
Incorporated several bugfixes to *lexgen*.  Compiler now compiles to
fixpoint when using lexgen instead of *ml-lex*.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/02/28]::
+
Removed *ml-flex* and added *lexgen* instead, using Aaron Turon's newly
provided tarball.  The generated lexers still have problems.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/02/26]::
+
Removed *ml-flex*'s dependency on *regexp-lib.cm*.  Turned installation
of *ml-flex* on by default.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/02/24]::
+
Added *ml-flex* sources.  Partially integrated, but should not be
turned on yet!  (Read: leave it commented-out in `config/targets`!)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/02/23]::
+
Changes to support building on *x86-64* systems (using the 32-bit mode).
Also cleaned up signal handling on *Linux*.  Support for pre-2.2 *Linux*
kernels dropped.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/02/22]::
+
*CM* has changed.  Updated the script for rebuilding the *MLRISC* generated
files.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/02/14]::
+
Hooked code for Darwin-specific Intel ABI into main compiler.
(This is a temporary solution which relies on the fact that the
compiler itself does not use NLFFI.  Eventually we need to divorce
intel mac from generic x86 unix code and make separate sets of binaries.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/02/13]::
+
Changed *MLRISC* x86 `CCalls` for partial support of *Mac OS X* ABI.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2006/02/06]::
+
Changes to support *Mac OS X* on Intel hardware.  The C-calls support in
MLRISC must also be updated to support the *Mac OS X* ABI.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/12/16]::
+
Improved error reporting and handling in *CM*.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/11/21]::
+
Enabling `$/html-lib.cm` in `config/preloads` did not work.  This is fixed
now.  (Since the anchor mapping for `html-lib.cm` is not yet in effect
at the time when `config/preloads` is processed, the library has to
be referred to by another name.  In 110.57 this would be
`$SMLNJ-LIB/HTML/html-lib.cm`.  I arranged for `$smlnj/smlnj-lib/html-lib.cm`
to be valid as well.)
+
Thanks to Todd Wilson (Fresno) for alerting me to this issue.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.57; 2005/11/19


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/11/19]::
+
Fixed a problem in `config/install.sh` where it tries to "fish" the
name of the *CM* metadata directory from the wrong place (because
the physical location of `basis.cm` has changed).  Also, corrected the
path anchor for `$/html-lib.cm`.  (Thanks to M. Fluet for pointing out
these problems.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.57; 2005/11/16


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/11/16]::
+
Fixed problem with bogus exception message when using back-trace
facility.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/11/15]::
+
Added simple implementation of `Array2.copy`.  (Warning: mostly untested.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/11/15]::
+
Reversed change to `src/system/smlnj/internals/versiontool.cm`.  This
file gets loaded as a tool -- by the equivalent of CM.make during the
run of `CMB.make`.  Thus, CMB's path configuration is meaningless for
it.  Instead, it has the status of "user code", so it should use
`$/basis.cm` to refer to the Basis library.  (At least that's true for
the purpose of bootstrapping the previous change.  In the future it
might make sense to have `versiontool.cm` refer to
`$smlnj/basis/basis.cm`, _i.e._, the version of the Basis that the
compiler itself uses.)
+
Also patched `src/system/testml` to have it activate those extra anchor
bindings in `config/extrapathconfig`.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/11/15]::
+
This change affects the way the following libraries are tied into
the system:
+
....................
   $/basis.cm
   $/smlnj-lib.cm
   $/pp-lib.cm
   $/controls-lib.cm
   $/html-lib.cm
   $/ml-yacc-lib.cm
....................
+
These libraries are now internally (as seen from the source code
of the implementation itself) known by the following names:
+
....................
   $smlnj/basis/basis.cm
   $smlnj/smlnj-lib/smlnj-lib.cm
   $smlnj/smlnj-lib/pp-lib.cm
   $smlnj/smlnj-lib/controls-lib.cm
   $smlnj/smlnj-lib/html-lib.cm
   $smlnj/ml-yacc/ml-yacc-lib.cm
....................
+
This makes it possible to work with code that requires different
versions of these libraries, and which refers to these libraries using
their "default" names (_i.e._, the first set of names above).  In other
words, one can un-define or re-define those default names without
compromising the proper functioning of the compiler itself.
+
A similar procedure had already been performed for several of the
*MLRISC* libraries that are linked into the compiler.  I did some
cleanup on this code.
+
A new file in the config directory (named extrapathconfig) is
responsible for setting up path anchors that the compiler itself does
not need, but that are typically required by user code.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/11/07]::
+
Fixed erroneous out-of-bounds test in the "`update`" function of
various *`ArraySlice` modules.  (Thanks to Vesa A. Norrman for pointing
out the problem.)
+
Pushed some Basis changes through ML-Lex, CML, and eXene.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/11/07]::
+
Fixed a Basis incompatibility: The depreciated function `Substring.all`
was removed (use `Substring.full` instead).
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/11/05]::
+
Tweaked interval set API in SML/NJ library; see the CHANGES file for details.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/11/02]::
+
--
* Runtime system bootstrap code now accepts hex digits in BOOTLIST
  in either upper case or lower case format.
* Pushed changes to names of `Pack`<__N__>{`Big`,`Little`}
  structures through
  CML and eXene.
--
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/11/02]::
+
Fixed a Basis incompatibility: `Pack`<__N__>{`Big`,`Little`}
structures should be named `PackWord`<__N__>{`Big`,`Little`}.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/10/28]::
+
Fixed a minor Basis incompatibility: hex digits should be upper case.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.56; 2005/10/25


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/10/25]::

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/10/14]::
+
Add Zhong Shao's fix for datatype equality functions.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/10/14]::
+
Bug fix a bug found by Carl Hauser.
There was a typo in the reload code for `FCMP` in `x86SpillInstr.sml`.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/10/14]::
+
Removed some debugging code in file `x86Asm.sml`.
The function emit_operand was printing out debugging output.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/07/27]::
+
Fixed *ml-lex* to recognize "`\r`" as representing carriage return.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/07/27]::
+
Fixed *ml-yacc* to work on files with non-native end-of-line
encodings (_e.g._, Windows text file on a Unix system).
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/07/20]::
+
Added changes from Dominic Evans (oldmanuk (at) gmail (dot) com)
to support *HPUX 11*.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/07/06]::
+
Changes to the *SML/NJ Library*.  See smlnj-lib/CHANGES for details.
+
owner:www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr[John Reppy]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/07/06]::
+
Fixed reversed logic for deciding whether to "copy up" or "copy down"
in *`-array-slice.sml`.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/05/31]::
+
A typo in the Cygwin code fixed.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/05/31]::
+
Updated Cygwin's fault/signal handling to match the Windows version.
Updated the export list.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.54; 2005/05/18


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/05/18]::
+
Added support scripts for *Mac OS X PackageMaker* and modified
`config/install.sh` so that it supports re-dumping a heap image
after customization.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/05/18]::
+
Un-overloaded / to work around bug in overloading resolution code.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/05/16]::
+
Added mechanism for re-creating a heap file for the interactive system
after configuration variables have been changed.
+
[source,sml]
------------
   CM.redump_heap : string -> unit
------------
+
This is much like `SMLofNJ.exportML`, but starting from the resulting
heap does not return to the caller of `CM.redump_heap` but
restarts the interactive system from scratch.  The original call of
`CM.redump_heap` does not return but ends the interactive session.
Thus, `CM.redump_heap` is a lot like `SMLofNJ.exportFn`.
+
Internally, `redump_heap` winds the dynamic execution context back to
the point where the original heap image was created and re-executes
the heap image generation code in the boot code.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/05/09]::
+
Added a hack to the existing hack known as `Word64` to make `fromString`
behave correctly.  I am still not sure whether `Word64.scan` will work
as specified with respect to the interaction of radix and prefix.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/05/04]::
+
Added a gc protocol checking phase.  This phase is enabled with
the flag "check-gc".  "debug-check-gc" turns on the verbose mode.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/05/04]::
+
Fixed a bug in the implementation of `div` and `mod` for `IntInf`.
Thanks to Neophytos Michael for reporting the problem.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/05/04]::
+
Added the `join` combinator to the `ParserComb` module in the
*SML/NJ Library*.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/02/28]::
+
Fixed serious bug (brown paper bag variety) in new implementation of
structure `Atom` in *CML*.  (I had accidentally used a `mailbox` instead of
an `mvar`, leaving the door open for races.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.53; 2005/02/25


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/02/25]::
+
Brought back `SMLofNJ.Susp`.  The underlying suspension type is the one
implemented in Core, which means that it is the same as the one used
by the lazy extension.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/02/24]::
+
Simpler and at the same time more general implementation of structure
`Atom` in *CML*.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/02/15]::
+
Created new "`tools`" directory under "`src`" and moved "`TraceDebugProf`"
there.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/02/10]::
+
Implemented "`long long`" arguments and results for NLFFI.  (Only the
PPC/MacOS implementation is complete, the other backends still need to
be updated.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/01/24]::
+
Minor cleanup in ML-Yacc rule printing mechanism.  This should fix a
problem with certain "as" patterns which previously got rendered
using incorrect syntax.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/01/18]::
+
Made time profiling code (interrupt handler) in runtime system aware
of new array representation.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/01/14]::
+
Implemented new (but still experimental) *heap2exec* facility.  This is
tested under Mac OS X and should work under Linux (will test shortly).
It will probably also work on the Sparc (will test some time later).
Also removed old "`HACKED_STANDALONE`" hack from runtime
+
To be able to test *heap2exec*, uncomment the request for "`heap2asm`" in
config/targets prior to installation.  (Notice that this is different
from "heap2exec" mentioned below.  Not a typo.)
+
To perform an actual test, run the command
+
   $ bin/heap2exec heapfile execfile
+
(You can put *heap2exec* on your shell's path.)
+
For example, run
+
  $ bin/heap2exec bin/.heap/ml-yacc.ppc-darwin mly
+
This will create a standalone executable called "`mly`" that you can
then invoke directly as a command.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2005/01/07]::
+
fixed off-by-one error in `ML_STRING` macro (`globals.c`)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/12/23]::
+
Made *ml-build* script "smarter" (but only very little).
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/12/21]::
+
* Implemented access to signed and unsigned long long data in *NLFFI*.
(The parameter-passing part of the picture has not complete. But
data structure access seems to work.)

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/12/17]::
+
The Unix I/O library of SML/NJ on Cygwin does not understand
Windows style pathname, so problems arise when `SMLNJ_HOME` is set
to a Windows style pathname.  The _run-sml script now
converts `SMLNJ_HOME` to a POSIX pathname on Cygwin.

== Version 110.52; 2004/12/15


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/12/15]::
+
More on the space problem (this time for *Win32*).
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/12/14]::
+
Hacked some of the scripts (in particular: the installer) to cope with
spaces in filenames a bit better.  But beware: the current "solution"
is likely still full of bugs and inherently incomplete.  (We need to
do away with those shell scripts for a comprehensive solution.)

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/12/13]::
+
Fixed bug in code for *ml-makedepend*.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/12/09]::
+
Added two simple but potentially useful statistics modules to SML/NJ Library.
(See CHANGES file there.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/12/01]::
+
Updates to *SML/NJ Library*
+
--
  * Added function `HashString.hashString'` for substrings.
  * Hand-inlined `CharVector.foldl` into `HashString` (for speed).
  * Modified implementation of structure `Atom` to avoid extracting
    strings from substrings unless necessary.
--
+
(Also see CHANGES file for smlnj-lib.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/11/24]::
+
Made sure *CML* compiles when the `Position` structure is `Int64`.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/11/24]::
+
The compiler can now be compiled in a mode that makes structure `Position`
equal to `Int64`.  The default, however, is unchanged (`Position` is `Int31`)
for the time being.
+
To enable 64-bit positions, use the following procedure:
+
--
. Start sml
. Autoload $smlnj/cmb.cm (if not already autoloaded)
. Type
+
[source,sml]
------------
#set (CMB.symval "USE_64_BIT_POSITIONS") (SOME 1);
------------
+
. Run `CMB.make()` as usual.
--
+
This is barely tested.  The only test so far was a little SML program
counting the number of characters in an 8-gigabyte file by
reading it character-by-character.  That test was successful.
+
In support of 64-bit positions, a number of new functions have been
added to the runtime system.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/11/23]::

Fixed a problem with unhelpful error messages related to problems with
`.cm` or `.sml` files that appear as part of the *sml* command line.

== Version 110.51; 2004/11/18


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/11/18]::
+
Enabled `dlopen` and friends for *FreeBSD* (as recommended by Johannes 5
Joemann).
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/11/17]::
+
Added support for `MLTree` constructs `LIVE` and `KILL`
to all the architectures.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/11/13]::
+
- Stripped down the `versiontool:` It now only handles the version number.
  The date string is generated at bootstrap time (during makeml).
+
- In a previous commit, fixed a minor issue with how polyequal is being
  translated.  In particular, the code now "looks through" abstractions.
  This results in slightly fewer polyEqual warnings and hopefully slightly
  more efficient code.  Important examples for where this matters are
  the new `int64` and `word64` types.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/11/12]::
+
Structure `Int64` fully hooked in.  (The implementation is not very
efficient, though.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/11/11]::
+
All the pieces of `Word64` are now there, with the exception of the
conversions from and to `LargeWord`. (Eventually these need to be identities,
but for the time being they don't even make sense because `LargeWord` is
32-bit wide.)
+
Also started to add similar support for `Int64`, but major pieces of that
are still missing.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/11/11]::
+
Structure `Word64` is now (almost) complete, word literals and patterns
seem to work.  There are a few odd pieces missing.  In particular,
I didn't do the {`from`,`to`}`LargeWord` parts because `LargeWord`
is still `Word32` at the moment.
+
Making `Word64` official would mean that `LargeWord` becomes `Word64`.  But
this requires extreme care because most word-word conversions have to
go through `LargeWord`, so making a mistake means loss of efficiency or
worse.  Eventually there will be a solution similar to (but actually
simpler than) what I did with `IntInf`.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/11/10]::
+
More 64-bit hacking (but still not even half-way there yet).
Also, some assorted improvements to the handling of 8-bit words.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/11/09]::
+
Started adding some infrastructure for supporting 64-bit int- and
word-types.  (Still in its very early stages.)
+

== Version 110.50; 2004/10/28


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/10/28]::
+
  - Changend config/srcarchiveurl from a file just
    containing the URL string into a file containing
    shell script code.  The code has access to the $VERSION variable.
  - Made corresponding changes to config/install.sh and config/unpack.
  - Default contents of config/srcarchiveurl uses $VERSION and
    normally does not have to be edited to reflect a version change.
+
(As a result, a version change can be done by just editing
`config/version`, the rest is now automatic.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/10/27]::
+
BackTrace.monitor now also reports the source of the exception that
triggered the trace.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/10/27]::
+
This is the HISTORY entry for two earlier commits, both concerning
the *x86* c-calls code in *MLRISC*:
+
  - added a missing LOAD in the code that deals with struct arguments
  - made sure the caller does not add the wrong number of bytes to the
    stack pointer after a call of a function returning a struct
    (the callee already pops the implicit argument which points to
     the space reserved for the result)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/10/24]::
+
John discovered a bug in the syntax of `fucomip`.
The opcodes `FU`?`COMIP`? have been changed to
+
       fu?comip? %st(i), %st
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/10/20]::
+
Added a mechanism for getting back-trace information from standalone
programs.  Here is how it works:
+
--
. The part of the program from which you want to get backtrace
  information (usually the whole program) should be wrapped with
  BackTrace.monitor.  This is a `(unit->'a)->'a` function, and your
  main program could be modified from something like
+
[source,sml]
------------
fun main (pgm, args) = ...
------------
+
to
+
[source,sml]
------------
fun main (pgm, args) = BackTrace.monitor (fn () => ...)
------------
+
. To be able to access `BackTrace.monitor`, you have to add the
  library `$smlnj-tdp/plugins.cm` to the `.cm` file that contains your
  main function.
+
. Remove all compiled code (_i.e._, all the .cm/ subdirectories that
  *CM* might have created in the past for your project).
+
. Build the system using this command line:
+
[source,sh]
------------
ml-build -Ctdp.instrument=true \$smlnj-tdp/back-trace.cm myprog.cm MyProg.main myprog
------------
+
instead of the usual
+
[source,sh]
------------
ml-build myprog.cm MyProg.main myprog
------------
--
+
I changed the library name `$/trace-debug-profile.cm` to `$smlnj-tdp/plugins.cm`,
and added the following new libraries:
+
--
`$smlnj-tdp/back-trace.cm`::
+
when loaded causes the back-trace plugin to be installed
+
`$smlnj-tdp/coverage.cm`::
+
when loaded causes the coverage plugin to be installed
--
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/10/18]::
+
Added an "obsolete" warning for the "group owner" syntax to *CM*'s parser.
+
Eliminated group owner specs from `.cm` files throughout the source tree.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/10/15]::
+
--
* Test coverage tool added!
* Further reorganization of tracing-, debugging-, and profiling support:
+
    - moved original BTImp -- now called BackTrace -- into a separate
      library called $/trace-debug-profile.cm
    - eliminated all mentions of BTrace from SMLofNJ.Internals
    - only the instrumentation mechanism is now left in the compiler proper
    - BackTrace module is a plugin which is NOT plugged in by default
    - Coverage module is another such plugin
--
+
To get the benefits of any of these plugin modules, the code in
question must be compiled with TDP instrumentation turned on.  This
can be done by setting `SMLofNJ.Internals.TDP.mode` to `true`.
(The ref cell is also controlled via the `-Ctdp.instrument=...` switch.)
+
Plugins are selected at link time.  (Pre-compiled instrumented code
can be re-loaded with different plugins in effect.)  When an
instrumented module is linked, whatever plugins are at that time
enabled will come into effect for that module.
+
To enable the back-trace plugin, load library `$/trace-debug-profile.cm`
and invoke `BackTrace.install()` (_e.g._, from the interactive prompt).
To enable the coverage plugin, load the same library and invoke
`Coverage.install()`.
+
Back-traces are generated automatically on uncaught exceptions and
when the code in question explicitly invokes `BackTrace.trigger()`.
+
Coverage (and execution frequency-) information must be queried
explicitly by calling `Coverage.not_covered` and `Coverage.hot_spots`.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/10/14]::
+
Snapshot of a significant overhaul of how the `trace/debug/profile` support
is hooked into the system (specifically: `Core` and `SMLofNJ.Internals`).
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/10/13]::
+
Some rationalization of names:
+
   structure BTrace -> structure TDPInstrument
   etc.
+
This is is preparation of using the original back-trace
instrumentation for other purposes.  "TDP" stands for
Trace/Debug/Profile.
+
The control flag controlling whether instrumentation is on or off is now
registered under a different name, so instead of running sml as
+
 sml -Cinstrument.btrace-mode=true
+
one has to say
+
 sml -Ctdp.instrument=true
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/10/11]::
+
Made some minor modifications to elabcore.sml to have source regions
be propagated more tightly -- resulting in better (_i.e._, smaller)
regions being reported in error- and debug messages.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/10/08]::
+
Fixed handling of keywords in .cm files: After seeing "is" the lexer
treats subsequent occurrences of "group", "library", "source", "is",
"*", and "-" as ordinary identifiers rather than keywords.
+
Most seriously, this fixes a problem with CM's "shell" tool.  The tool
is supposed to accept a tool argument called "source", but this did
not work because of the clash with the keyword.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/10/07]::
+
Assorted cleanup work:
+
  - got rid of intstrmap in favor of using the library's
    hash table implementation
  - threw out most of the pathnames stuff, as it was not used anyway
  - simplified tokentable implementation
  - fixed some minor spelling errors
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/10/06]::
+
Cleaned up the absyn to reflect the invariant that HANDLE always
carries a FNexp as part of the type definition.  This eliminates some
superfluous sanity checks at runtime down the road.
+
Some minor cleanup of the btrace code.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/10/01]::
+
Added hack to make slave mode work in the presence of the version
tool.  (Still, since the master does two passes over the code for
CMB.make, the release number gets bumped twice when slaves are
attached.  I don't know if this is worth fixing...)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/09/30]::
+
* Moved the "version" magic into its own little library under
  src/system/smlnj/internal.  This avoids expensive reconstruction of
  a stable src/compiler/core.cm.
+
* At the same time, structure CompilerVersion is now known as
  structure SMLNJVersion.
+
* Arranged for the version tool to NOT kick in when rebuilding the system
  (makeml -rebuild, fixpt).  Otherwise one would never reach a fixpoint.
  Also, loading the versiontool does not work when rebuilding the system
  because CM is not properly initialized at that time.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/09/29]::
+
Implemented some CM magic to have
    file src/compiler/TopLevel/main/version.sml
generated automagically.
The version is taken from two files: config/version and config/release.
The first is expected to contain a two-part version number such as 110.49.
The second should contain a single number, but it may be missing.
+
If the environment variable VERSIONTOOL_BUMP_RELEASE is defined at the
time the version tool is loaded (which is the first time you say CMB.make),
then the tool will increment the value stored in config/release every
time CMB.make is invoked.
+
The binfile format is now insensitive to anything beyond the first
two components of a version number, so bumping the release does not render
binfiles incompatible.  Auto-bumping can be used to keep track of versions
during development without invalidating existing binfiles.
+
In any case, every CMB.make updates the date information in version.sml.
(This is the date that is printed in the banner.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/09/28]::
+
Some cleanup of the controls code.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/09/27]::
+
Added two pieces of functionality to the Controls interface:
+
[source,sml]
------------
val save'restore: 'a control -> unit -> unit
------------
+
grabs the current value of the control in stage 1 and restores it
in stage 2.
+
[source,sml]
------------
val set' : 'a control * 'a -> unit -> unit
------------
+
stores the given value into the control in stage 2 (_i.e._, delayed)
but does all error checking in stage 1.
(This is for string controls that need to do parse their argument --
something that might fail.  In some cases, notably in CM, one
already knows the intended argument but wants to delay the actual
assignment until a time when error recovery would be more difficult.)
+
Also changed the handling of controls in tool arguments to classes "`sml`" and
"`lazysml`":
+
--
   - use `Controls.save'restore` as a more robust way of restoring the
     old value (in particular: without having to re-parse the string)
   - use controls to handle the "`overload`" keyword in the init group
     (I believe this change actually fixes a long-standing obscure bug.)
--
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/09/27]::
+
Added a new tool class called "`lazysml`" to CM's tool chest.  The only
difference to "`sml`" is that compilation is done with `Control.lazysml`
set to true.  A source of class "`lazysml`" is automatically recognized
by a file name suffix of "`.lml`".
+
In addition to the above feature, the original class "`sml`" now also
supports a tool argument "`lazy`" which has the same effect.  As a
result, the following three lines are equivalent:
+
....................
    foo.sml : lazysml
    foo.sml : sml (lazy)
    foo.sml (lazy)
....................
+
The setting goes into effect both during parsing and during
compilation.  The original setting is restored right after parsing and
after compilation, respectively.
+
In addition to all the above, there is also a general mechanism to set
ANY of the "controls" that are available at the command line via
"`-C...`" on a per-sml-file basis.  The same rules that apply for "`lazy`"
apply as well. (In fact, "`lazy`" is implemented as a special case of
the general mechanism.)
+
The `.cm` file syntax uses a new keyword tool argument called "`with`".
There are several ways of indicating the desired settings:
+
....................
    foo.sml (with:parser.quotations=true)
    foo.sml (with:(name:parser.quotations value:true))
    foo.sml (with:(name:name1 value:value1 name:name2 value:value2 ...))
    foo.sml (with:(name1=value1 name2=value2 ...))
    foo.sml (with:(name1=value1 name:name2 value:value2 name3=value3 ...))
....................
+
Another possible abbreviation is to leave out the `=v` or `value:v` part
if the name refers to a boolean control (in which case the value is
taken to be true).  Thus, one could get lazy sml also by saying:
+
....................
    foo.sml (with:parser.lazy-keyword=true)
    foo.sml (with:parser.lazy-keyword)
    foo.sml (with:(name:parser.lazy-keyword value:true))
    foo.sml (with:(name:parser.lazy-keyword))
....................

Upon request by Johannes Joemann:

`single_source_shortest_paths` in `dijkstra.sml` was observed to get wrong
answers (by comparing to `single_source_shortest_paths` in `bellman-ford.sml`).

--
* various minor bugfixes to ml-nlffigen
+
* a beginning of a manual for nlffi
+
* eliminated 'export name=value' in config/install.sh as this does
  not work with certain versions of /bin/sh
  (Thanks to David King at Motorola for catching this.)
+
* several bugfixes provided or suggested by David Hansel at Reactive Systems:
  - added a test for `tm==NULL` to `gmtime.c` and `localtime.c`
  - applied patch for incorrect `GetFileTime` under `win32`
  - `toSeconds` -> `toMilliseconds` in `Win32/win32-process.sml`

- Fixed minor issue in *ml-nlffigen*: Now generate structure `T_foo`
  for a typedef to an incomplete type, but leave out the "`typ`" member.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/07/13]::

--
- use `paramAlloc` to report c-calls with too many arguments
  (for PPC version where parameter area is pre-allocated)
- added `ccall_maxargspace` to machspec (to implement the above)
- made "make" commend in CM's "make" tool configurable
- added option (default: on) for passing the name of the SML/NJ's "bin"
  directory to "make"; the call looks like this:
+
[source,sh]
-----------
make <options> SMLNJ_BINDIR=<dir> <target>

== Version 110.46.1; 2004/07/12

[2004/07/12]::
+
NLFFI under Mac OS X now working (sort of).  This is largely untested,
though.
+
.Note:
--
  . You have to make a new, clean build of the runtime system.
  . There are new BOOTFILES, you have to use them!
    (Doing the bootstrap process yourself would be *very* painful!
     If you absolutely have to do it, build the system under
     a different architecture and then cross-compile.)
--

Version bumped to 110.46.1 to account for runtime data format changes.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/06/18]::
+
Changed the implementation of structure `Unix` so that the same stream
is returned every time one of the {`text`,`bin`}{`In`,`Out`}`streamOf`
functions is invoked on the same proc.  This is not what the spec currently
says -- although IMO it arguably should.  (See discussion below.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.46; 2004/06/17


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/06/17]::
+
Changed the interface of structures Timer and Unix to match the most
recent Basis spec.
+
In the case of Unix there still seems to be an open/weird issue:
+
   The {text,bin}{In,Out}streamOf functions are supposed to create
   fresh streams whenever they are called -- as opposed to have them
   return the same stream every time.  This design is supposed to
   prevent space leaks caused by proc values hanging on to streams.
+
   The reap function, on the other hand, is supposed to close the
   streams.  This cannot be done without having a handle on the
   stream in proc after all...
+
I took the liberty to implement the following stopgap solution:
+
  The proc value hangs on to the most recently created stream(s).
  Reap closes those.  If either or both of the two streams hadn't
  been created at all yet, then reap will close the corresponding
  file descriptors directly.
+
PS: I don't understand the original space leak argument anymore.  If
a proc hangs on to the imperative stream, then I/O operations on those
will advance the state of the cached stream and avoid the space leak.
+

[2004/05/28]::
+
Added signature `PACK_REAL` and exported functor `PrimIO`.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/05/25]::
+
CM now ignores (but still accepts) the "owner" information in group
descriptions.  The owner of a group is its next enclosing
library. Each group must have a unique owner.  (There is a virtual
"toplevel" library that owns groups which are not nested within a real
library.)  Previously, each group had to explicitly declare its owner,
and CM would check that such a declaration is correct.  The new scheme
is to have CM check that for each group there is precisely one owning
library.
+
The advantage of the new scheme is that the programmer no longer needs
to maintain the somewhat annoying owner information.  The downside is
that CM cannot enforce the ownership rule across multiple runs of
CM.make.  Fortunately, enclosing the same group in two different
libraries A and B which are not part of the same program does not
cause real problems.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/05/20]::
+
Made the win32 version work again.  (Strangely, a misplaced comma had
slipped into win32-process.c which prevented the runtime from being
compiled correctly.)
+
Also, included a minor addition to ml-build.bat analogous to what was
done in blume-20040519-ml-build.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/05/19]::
+
Arranged for *ml-build* to clean up after itself a little bit better.
The script generates a temporary SML source file and compiles it using
CM, so CM generates metadata (GUID, SKEL, objectfile) for it.  It now
gets rid of those at the end, so they don't accumulate under .cm.
+
This required a minor change to install.sh because the name of the
metadata directory (default: .cm) is actually configurable at
installation time.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/05/18]::

Added Posix.IO.mk{Bin,Text}{Reader,Writer} by lifting their respective
implementations from internal modules PosixBinPrimIO and PosixTextPrimIO.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2004/05/11]::
+
Added previously missing support for many socket-related functions
under win32.  Thanks to David Hansel <hansel@reactive-systems.com>
for the voluminous patch!
+
(I have not tested this patch under win32 yet.)
+
Here is David's e-mail:
+
Hi,
+
Attached to this email you find a diff against sml/nj 110.45
that will enable socket support under Windows.
+
To apply the patch (using unix or cygwin)
1) gunzip runtime.diff.gz
2) "cd" into "src/runtime" in the source tree of a fresh
   110.45 installation.
3) patch -p 1 < [your/path/to]runtime.diff
+
The code compiles fine but has NOT yet been extensively tested.
I only ran a few tests for basic socket client functionality
(which worked fine).  Especially the functions that use ioctl
are not tested at all and might not work (see below).
+
I implemented this since we want to move to a newer version of sml/nj
but need socket support in order to use it.  This is the first time I
even had a look at the sml/nj source,  so please review my changes
before making this part of the distribution!  Here are a few issues
that I think might be better for someone to solve who is more
familiar with the sml/nj source (and socket programming):
+
- getnetbyaddr.c and getnetbyname.c will raise a "not implemented"
  exception since I could not figure out what the windows equivalent
  of these functions is
+
- In sockets-osdep.h there are a some #include statements that are
  only used in a few files that include sockets-osdep.h
+
- In smlnj-sock-lib.c, function init_fn() calls WSAStartup() but
  does not process its return value since I don't know how to
  report an error upwards.
+
- It would probably be good to have a call to WSACleanup() when
  the library is unloaded (if there is such a possibility).
  Otherwise I think Windows will take care of this automatically
  when the process finishes.
+
- I used ioctlsocket() as a replacement for ioctl() but I have
  no idea if that is actually the proper replacement on Windows.
+
- All these issues are marked in the code by "FIXME" comments.
+
We use sml/nj extensively in our products and are quite happy
with it.  I hope this contribution will help you.
+
Keep up the good work!
+
David

[2004/05/11]::
+
The installer now honors the "src-smlnj" target again, although its meaning
has changed from "all sources required for the compiler" to "all sources
the installer knows about".  In other words, if you enable "src-smlnj"
in the "targets" file, then the installer will pull in sources for
everything.  (Notice that this refers to source code only.  Compiled
code is still only installed for modules that were requested explicitly
or which are required for other modules that were requested explicitly.)

Fixed the runtime so that ml-nlffi-lib runs on the cygwin version
of SML/NJ.  The problem is that
+
   lib = dlopen(NULL, ...)
   f   = dlsym(lib, "malloc");
+
does not work on Windows unless we explicitly export symbols
such as 'malloc' during linking.  We fixed this by explicitly
exporting the required symbols with the magic gcc incantation:
+
    -Wl,--export-all cygwin.def
+
where cygwin.def is a file containing all the symbols that
we wish to export.
+
I suspect this is a Windows problem and we'll have to
do the same (somehow with windows compilers) when
we build the native win32 version with the system
calls LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress.

Eliminated the "dont_move_libraries" directive in config/targets.
(The mechanism was broken and could not be fixed easily.  Moreover,
there does not seem to be any reason not to move all libraries into
lib during installation.  I originally implemented this directive as a
backward-compatibility feature when I first introduced the new CM.
Now that things have been stable for a long time and going back to the
old CM is not an option, there is no reason to keep it around.)

== Version 110.43.3; 2003/09/26


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/09/26]::
+
I modified the read-eval-print loop so that the autoloader gets
invoked whenever the prettyprinter tries to look up a symbol that
is not currently defined in the toplevel environment but which
appears in CM's autoload registry.  As a result, we see far fewer of
those ?.Foo.Bar.xxx names in the prettyprinter's output.
+
In addition to this I tried to clean up some pieces of the Basis
implementation (_e.g._, Socket, Word8Array) in order to prevent other
instances of these ?.Foo.Bar.xxx names from being printed.
+
The mechanism that picks names for types still needs some work, though.
(Right now it seems that if there is a type A.t which is defined to
be B.u, but B is unavailable at toplevel, then A.t gets printed as
"?.B.u" although the perhaps more sensible solution would be to use
"A.t" in this case.  In other words, the prettyprinter should follow
a chain of DEFtycs not farther than there are corresponding toplevel
names in the current environment.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/09/24]::
+
Another installer tweak:  All the ML code for the installer is now
compiled during CMB.make and put into a little library called
$smlnj/installer.cm.  The installation then simply invokes
+
....................
   sml -m $smlnj/installer.cm
....................
+
and everything happens automagically.
+
Win32:  ML code senses value of environment variable `SMLNJ_HOME`.
Unix:   ML code senses values of environment variables `ROOT`, `CONFIGDIR`,
        and `BINDIR`.
+
The new scheme guarantees that the ML code responsible for the installation
is in sync with the APIs of the main system.  Also, the installer is
somewhat faster because the installer script is precompiled.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/09/24]::
+
Added a signature SYNCHRONOUS_SOCKET to basis.cm.  This is like SOCKET
but excludes all non-blocking operations.  Defined SOCKET (in Basis)
and CML_SOCKET in terms of SYNCHRONOUS_SOCKET.  Removed superfluous
implementations of non-blocking operations from CML's Socket
structure.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/09/24]::
+
1. Fixed SOCKET API and implementation to match Basis spec.
   This required changing the internal representation of sockets to one
   that remembers (for each socket file descriptor) whether it is currently
   blocking or non-blocking.  This state is maintained lazily (_i.e._, a system
   call is made only if the state actually needs to change).
+
2. OS-specific details of sockets were moved into separate files, thus
   making it possible to unify the bulk of the socket implementations
   between Unix and Win32.
+
3. CML's socket API changed accordingly.
   (Note that we need to remove non-blocking functions from this API
   since they are redundant in the case of CML!)
+
4. CML's socket implementation now makes use of non-blocking functions
   provided by Basis, thus removing all OS-dependent code from this part
   of CML.
+
5. Changed Real64.precision from 52 to 53.  Minor cleanup in Real64 code.

1. Exported fractionsPerSecond etc. from TimeImp (but not from Time as

   Posix.ProcEnv.times.
+
2. Added Time.{from,to}Nanoseconds to Time.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/09/17]::

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/09/09]::
+
Rewrote large parts of config/install.sh in SML (config/libinstall.sml).
Modified config/install.bat to take advantage of it.  Also modified
config/install.sh (and called it config/new-install.sh) to take advantage
of it on Unix systems.  (The SML code is (supposed to be) platform-
independent.)
+
The installer can now install everything under Win32
as well as under *nix as long as it compiles.
+
Other changes:
+
  - made CML compile again under Win32
  - made eXene compile under Win32 (by providing a fake structure UnixSock
    and by using OS.Process.getEnv instead of Posix.ProcEnv.getenv)
  - fixed a bug in nowhere: it assumed that type OS.Process.status is the
    same as type int;  under Win32 it isn't
  - fixed some slice-related problems in the win32-specific parts of CML
  - added a functor argument "sameVol" to os-path-fn.sml in the Basis
    (under Win32, the volume name is case-insensitive, and the
    OS.Path code compares volume names for equality)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/09/08]::
+
Made Win32 version of OS.FileSys.fullPath return current directory
when given an empty string.  This is what the spec says, and incidentally,
CM depends on it.  (CM otherwise goes into an infinite loop in certain
cases when presented with the name of a non-existing .cm file.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/09/04]::
+
  1. Changed interface to vectors and arrays in Basis to match
     (draft) Basis spec.
  2. Added signatures and implementations of slices according to
     Basis spec.
  3. Edited source code throughout the system to make it compile again
     under 1. and 2.  (In some cases code had to be added to have it
     match the new signatures.)
  4. MLRISC should be backward-compatible: the copies of the originals
     of files that needed to change under 3. were retained, the .cm files
     check the compiler version number and use old versions when
     appropriate.
  5. Changed type of OS.FileSys.readDir and Posix.FileSys.readdir to
     dirstream -> string option (in accordance with Basis spec).
  6. When generating code that counts lines, *ml-lex* used function
     CharVector.foldli, taking advantage of its old interface.
     This has been replaced with the corresponding code from
     CharVectorSlice.  (html-lex must be re-lexed!)
  7. BitArray in smlnj-lib/Util has been extended/modified to match the
     new MONO_ARRAY signature.  (Do we need BitArraySlice?)
  8. Removed temporary additions (fromInternal, toInternal) from the
     (now obsolete) IntInf in smlnj-lib/Util.
  9. Cleaned up structure Byte.
 10. Added localOffset, scan, and fromString to Date (according to spec).
     Cleaned/corrected implementation of Date.
     (Still need to check for correctness; implement better canonicalizeDate.)
 11. Added "scan" to signature IEEE_REAL.
 12. Some improvements to IntInf [in particular: efficiency-hack for
     mod and rem when second operand is 2 (for parity checks).]
 13. Changed representation of type Time.time, using a single IntInf.int
     value counting microseconds.  This considerably simplified the
     implementation of structure Time.  We now support negative time
     values; scan and fromString handle signs.
 14. Functor PrimIO now takes two additional arguments (VectorSlice and
     ArraySlice).

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/08/28]::
+
This is a major update which comes with a version number bump
(110.42.99 -- yes, we are really close to 110.43 :-), NEW BOOTFILES,
and an implementation of `IntInf` in the Basis.

There are a fairly large number of related changes and updates throughout
the system:
+
Basis:
	- Implemented IntInf.
	- Made LargeInt a projection of IntInf (by filtering through INTEGER).
	- Added some missing Real64 operations, most notably Real.toLargeInt.
	- Added FixedInt as a synonym for Int32.
+
compiler:
	* Added support for a built-in intinf type.
        --
	  - literals
	  - pattern matching
	  - conversion shortcuts (`Int32.fromLarge o Int.toLarge` etc.)
	  - overloading on literals and operations
        --
	This required adding a primitive type intinf, some additional
	primops, and implementations for several non-trivial intinf
	operations in Core.  (The intinf type is completely abstract
	to the compiler; all operations get delegated back to the Core.)
+
	* Intinf equality is handled by polyequal.  However, the compiler
	does not print its usual warning in this case (since polyequal
	is the right thing to do there).
+
	* Improved the organization of structure `InlineT`.
+
	* A word about conversion primops:
	If conversions involving intinf do not cancel out during
	CPS contract, then the compiler must insert calls to Core functions.
	Since all core access must be resolved already during the FLINT
	translate phase, it would be too late a the time of CPS contract
	to add new Core calls.  For this reason, conversion primops
	for intinf carry two arguments:  1. the numeric argument that
	they are supposed to convert, and 2. the Core function that
	can help with this conversion if necessary.  If CPS contract
	eliminates a primop, then the associated Core function becomes
        dead and goes away.  Intinf conversion primops that do not get
        eliminated by CPS contract get rewritten into calls of their
        core functions by a separate, new phase.
+
interactive system:
	- Control.Print.intinfDepth controls max length of intinf constants
	being printed. (Analogous to Control.Print.stringDepth.)
	- Cleanup in printutil and pputil: got rid of unused stuff and
	duplicates; replaced some of the code with code that makes better
	use of library functionality.
+
CM:
	Bugfix: parse-errors in init group (system/smlnj/init/init.cmi)
	are no longer silent.
+
CKIT:
	Fixed mismatched uses of Int32 and LargeInt.  I always decided
	in favor of LargeInt -- which is now the same as IntInf.
	CKIT-knowledgable people should check whether this is what's
	intended and otherwise change things back to using Int32 or
	FixedInt.
+
Throughout the code:
        Started using IntInf.int literals and built-in operations
	(_e.g._, comparison with 0) where this seems appropriate.

[2003/08/13]::
+
Merging changes from the mcz-branch development branch into trunk.
These changes involve replacement of the emulated old prettyprinter
interface with direct use of the SML/NJ Lib PP library, and fixing
of a couple of bugs (895, 1186) relating to error messages.  A new
prettyprinter for ast datatypes (Elaborator/print/ppast.{sig,sml})
has been added.

== Version 110.42.9; 2003/08/11


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/08/11]::
+
This patch restores SML/NJ's ability to run under win32.  There are a
number of changes, including fixes for several bugs that had gone
unnoticed until now:
+
--
* uname "CYGWIN_NT*" is recognized as win32 (This is relevant only when
  trying to run the win32 version from within cygwin.)

* There are a number of simple .bat scripts that substitute for their
  corresponding Unix shell-scripts.  (See below.)

* The internals of *ml-build* have been modified slightly.  The main
  difference is that instead of calling ".link-sml" (or link-sml.bat)
  using `OS.Process.system`, the ML process delegates this task back
  to the script.  Otherwise problems arise in mixed environments such
  as Cygwin where scripts look and work like Unix scripts, but
  where OS.Process.system cannot run them.

* In CM, the srcpath pickler used native pathname syntax -- which
  is incorrect in the case of cross-compilation.  The new pickle format
  is independent of platform-specific naming conventions.

* Path configuration files (such as lib/pathconfig) can now choose
  between native and standard syntax.  Placing a line of the form
+
        standard!
+
into the file causes all subsequent paths to be interpreted using
CM standard pathname syntax (= Unix conventions); a line
+
        native!
+
switches back to native style.  This was needed so that
path config files can be written portably, see src/system/pathconfig.

* Runtime system:
+
  - `win32-filesys.c`:  `get_file_time` and `set_file_time` now
    access modification time, not creation time.

  - I/O code made aware of new array representation.

  - Bug fixes in `X86.prim.masm`.

  - `src/system/makeml` made aware of win32. (For use under cygwin
       and other Unix-environments for windows.)

  - In Basis, fixed off-by-one error in win32-io.sml (function vecF)
    which caused BinIO.inputAll to fail consistently.

* .bat scripts:
+
   Windows .bat scripts assume that `SMLNJ_HOME` is defined.
+
   - sml.bat, ml-yacc.bat, ml-lex.bat:  Driver scripts for standalone
     applications (sml, *ml-yacc*, *ml-lex*).
   - ml-build.bat: analogous to *ml-build*.
   - config\install.bat:  Analogous to config/install.sh.  This requires
     that `SMLNJ_HOME` is set and that Microsoft Visual C is ready to use.
     (nmake etc. must be on the path, and vcvars32 must have been run.)
     Moreover, sources for *ml-lex* and *ml-yacc* need to exist under src,
     and the bootfile hierarchy must have been unpacked under
     sml.boot.x86-win32.
     The script is very primitive and does a poor job at error checking.
     It only installs the base system, *ml-lex*, and *ml-yacc*.  No other
     libraries are being installed (_i.e._, you get only those that
     are part of the compiler.)
   - link-sml.bat:  analogous to .link-sml, but not currently used

* Unrelated bug fixes:

  - ml-nlffigen now exports structures ST_* corresponding to incomplete
    types.
  - Added getDevice to PP/src/pp-debug-fn.sml.  (Would not compile
    otherwise.)

[2003/06/17]::
+
Modified compiler/Elaborator/print/pptype.sml to fix bug 895.
Tag will be used for new development branch (mcz-branch) for
use by MacQueen, (Lucasz) Zairek, and (George) Cao at uchicago.
+

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/05/27]::
+
Tried to eliminated most cases of polymorphic equality.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/05/21]::
+
Two changes:
+
  1. Added a flag for controlling whether non-exhaustive bindings will
     be treated as errors (default is false).
  2. Cleaned up the *entire* source tree so that CMB.make goes through
     without a single non-exhaustive match- or bind warning.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/05/17]::
+
1. Added cases for IF, WHILE, ANDALSO, and ORELSE to Absyn.
+
This mainly affects the quality of error messages.  However, some
of the code is now more straightforward than before. (Treatment of
the above four constructs in translate.sml is much simpler than
the "macro-expansion" that was going on before.  Plus, the mach-
compiler no longer gets invoked just to be able to compile an
if-expression.)
+
2. The ErrorMsg.Error exception is now caught and absorbed by the
   interactive loop.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/blume/[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/05/16]::
+
Ported the runtime system to cygwin, which uses the unix
x86-unix bin files.  Missing/buggy features:
--
   * getnetbyname, getnetbyaddr: these functions seem to be missing in
     the Cygwin library.
   * Ctrl-C handling may be flaky.
   * Windows system calls and Windows I/O are not supported.
--
A new set of binfiles is located at:
+
http://www.dorsai.org/~leunga/boot.x86-unix.tgz[]
+
This is only needed for bootstrapping the cygwin version of smlnj.
Other x86 versions can use the existing binfiles.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/04/08]::
+
--
1. Added a target 'mlrisc' to installer.
+
2. Added missing elements to structure ListPair.
--
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2003/01/07]::
+
Fixed a bug in Int.rem(x,y) where y is a power of 2 on x86.
The arguments to the SUBL instruction were swapped.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/12/12]::
+
Fixed a serious bug in the rewrite code for FP spilling/reloading that
sent the RA into an infinite loop when floating point registers get
spilled.  (Because of this bug, _e.g._, nucleic stopped compiling between
110.37 and 110.38.)
There was another set of potential problems related to the handling of
MLRISC annotations (but those did not yet cause real problems, apparently).
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/12/06]::
+
Added a call of SrcPath.sync at the beginning of Parse.parse (in CM).
This fixes the problem of CM getting confused by files that suddenly
change their identity (_e.g._, by getting unlinked and recreated by some
text editor such as vi).  There might be a better/cheaper/cleaner way
of doing this, but for now this will have to do.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/10/28]::
+
Exported structure Typecheck from $smlnj/viscomp/core.cm.

//====================================================================
== Version 110.42.1; 2002/10/17


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/10/17]::
+
In good old tradition, there has been a slight hiccup so that we have
to patch 110.42 after the fact.   The old release tag has been replaced
(see below).
+
The change solves a problem with two competing approaches the
configuration problem regarding MacOS 10.1 vs. MacOS 10.2 which got in
each other's way.
+
This change only affects the runtime system code and the installer script.
(No new bootfiles.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.42; 2002/10/16


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/10/10]::
+
The mltree operator DIVS must be implemented with an overflow check on
the PPC because the hardware indicates divide-by-zero using "overflow" as
well.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/07/23]::
+
Sml now senses the `SMLNJ_HOME` environment variable.  If this is set,
then the bin dir is assumed to be in `$SMLNJ_HOME/bin` and (unless
`CM_PATHCONFIG` is also set), the path configuration file is assumed
to be in `$SMLNJ_HOME/lib/pathconfig`.  This way one can easily move
the entire tree to some other place and everything will "just work".
+
(Companion commands such as *ml-build* and *ml-makedepend* also sense this
variable.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/07/12]::
+
Exported two useful "step" functions from liveness module (MLRISC).

owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.41; 2002/07/05


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/07/05]::
+
Exported structure BTImp from `$smlnj/viscomp/debugprof.cm` so that
other clients can set up backtracing support.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/06/25]::
+
Fixed a bug in translation of `INLMAX` (and `INLMIN`) for the floating-point
case.  (The sense of the `isNaN` test was reversed -- which made `min` and
`max` always return their first argument.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/06/11]::
+
Back-ported OS.Path.{from,to}UnixPath from idlbasis-devel branch.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/06/10]::
+
I back-ported my implementation of `IEEEReal.fromString` from the
idlbasis-devel branch so that we can test it.
+
Another small change is that ppDec tries to give more information
than just "<sig>" in the case of functors.  However, this code is
broken in some mysterious way if the functor's body's signature
has not been declared by ascription but gets inferred from the
implementation.  This needs fixing...
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/05/31]::
+
Resurrected `SMLofNJ.Internals.BTrace.mode`.  (It accidentally fell by
the wayside when I switched over to using Controls everywhere.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------

the fall-through and target blocks obvious.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/05/21]::
+
CM documentation update.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/05/21]::
+
- John tweaked runtime to be silent on heap export (except when
  GC messages are on).
- I added a few more things (cross-compiling versions of CMB) to
  config/preloads (as suggestions).
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/05/20]::
+
- Added `ControlUtil` structure to `control-lib.cm`.
- Use it throughout.
- Used Controls facility to define *MLRISC* controls (as opposed to
  registering *MLRISC* control ref cells with Controls after the fact)
- Fixed messed-up controls priorities.
+
* Removed again all the stuff from `config/preloads` that one wouldn't
  be able to preload at the time the initial heap image is built.
  (Many libraries, _e.g._, CML, do not exist yet at this time.  The
   only libraries that can be preloaded via config/preloads are those
   that come bundled with the bootfiles.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/05/20]::
+
Added a lot of commented-out suggestions for things to be included
in config/preloads.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/05/18]::
+
* Made the mdl tool stuff compile and run again.
* I've disabled all the stuff that depends on RTL specifications; they
  are all badly broken anyway.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/05/17]::
+
1. John Reppy made several modifications to the *SML/NJ Library*.
   In particular, there is a shiny new controls-lib.cm.
+
2. Pushed new controls interface through compiler so that everything
   compiles again.
+
3. Added `FormatComb` and `FORMAT_COMB` to the *CML* version of the
   *SML/NJ Library* (so that *CML* compiles again).
+
4. Modified init scripts because XXX_DEFAULT environment variables
   are no longer with us.  (Boot-time initialization is now done
   using the same environment variables that are also used for
   startup-time initialization of controls.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/05/15]::
+
All pseudo-ops emitted before the first segment declaration
such as `TEXT`, `DATA`, and `BSS` directives are assumed to be global
declarations and are emitted first in the assembly file. This is
useful in a number of situations where one has pseudo-ops that are not
specific to any segment, and also works around the constraint that one
cannot have client pseudo-ops in the `TEXT` segment.
+
Because no segment is associated with these declarations it is
an error to allocate any space or objects before the first segment
directive and an exception will be raised. However, we cannot make
this check for client pseudo-ops.
+
These top level declarations are a field in the CFG `graph_info`.
In theory you can continue to add to this field after the CFG has been
built -- provided you know what you are doing;-)
+
owner:smlnj.org[Lal George]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/05/13]::
+
A few minor bugfixes:
+
  - Stopgap measure for bug recently reported by Elsa Gunter (ppDec).
    (Bogus printouts for redefined bindings still occur.  Compiler
    bug should no longer occur now.  We need to redo the prettyprinter
    from scratch.)
+
  - CM pathname printer now also adds escape sequences for ( and )
+
  - commend and docu fixes for ml-nlffi
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/05/10]::
+
Applied the following bugfix provided by Emden Gansner:
+
    Output is corrupted when outputSubstr is used rather than output.
+
    The problem occurs when a substring
+
	ss = (s, dataStart, dataLen)
+
    where dataStart > 0, fills a stream buffer with avail bytes left.
    avail bytes of s, starting at index dataStart, are copied into the
    buffer, the buffer is flushed, and then the remaining dataLen-avail
    bytes of ss are copied into the beginning of the buffer. Instead of
    starting this copy at index dataStart+avail in s, the current code
    starts the copy at index avail.
+
    Fix:
    In text-io-fn.sml, change line 695 from
	 val needsFlush = copyVec(v, avail, dataLen-avail, buf, 0)
    to
	 val needsFlush = copyVec(v, dataStart+avail, dataLen-avail, buf, 0)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/04/12]::
+
1. Grabbed newer assyntax.h from the XFree86 project.
2. Fiddled with how to compile X86.prim.asm without warnings.
3. (Very) Minor cleanup in CM.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/04/01]::
+
Added full support for div/mod/rem/quot on the x86, using the machine
instruction's two results (without clumsily recomputing the remainder)
directly where appropriate.
+
Some more extensive power-of-two support was added to the x86 instruction
selector (avoiding expensive divs, mods, and muls where they can be
replaced with cheaper shifts and masks).  However, this sort of thing
ought to be done earlier, _e.g._, within the CPS optimizer so that
all architectures benefit from it.
+
The compiler compiles to a fixed point, but changes might be somewhat
fragile nevertheless.  Please, report any strange things that you might
see wrt. div/mod/quot/rem...
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/03/29]::
+
Fixed my broken div/mod logic.  Unfortunately, this means that the
inline code for div/mod now has one more comparison than before.
Fast paths (quotient > 0 or remainder = 0) are not affected, though.
The problem was with quotient = 0, because that alone does not tell
us which way the rounding went.  One then has to look at whether
remainder and divisor have the same sign...  :(
+
Anyway, I replaced the bootfiles with fresh ones...
+

//====================================================================
== Version 110.39.3; 2002/03/29


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/03/29]::
+
Primops have changed. This means that the bin/boot-file formats have
changed as well.
+
To make sure that there is no confusion, I made a new version.
+
+
CHANGES:
+
* removed REMT from mltree (remainder should never overflow).
+
* added primops to deal with divisions of all flavors to the frontend
+
* handled these primops all the way through so they map to their respective
  MLRISC support
+
* used these primops in the implementation of Int, Int32, Word, Word32
+
* removed INLDIV, INLMOD, and INLREM as they are no longer necessary
+
* parameterized INLMIN, INLMAX, and INLABS by a numkind
+
* translate.sml now deals with all flavors of INL{MIN,MAX,ABS}, including
  floating point
+
* used INL{MIN,MAX,ABS} in the implementation of Int, Int32, Word, Word32,
  and Real (but Real.abs maps to a separate floating-point-only primop)
+
+
TODO items:
+
* Hacked Alpha32 instruction selection, disabling the selection of REMx
  instructions because the machine instruction encoder cannot handle
  them.  (Hppa, PPC, and Sparc instruction selection did not handle
  REM in the first place, and REM is supported by the x86 machine coder.)
+
* Handle DIV and MOD with DIV_TO_NEGINF directly in the x86 instruction
  selection phase.  (The two can be streamlined because the hardware
  delivers both quotient and remainder at the same time anyway.)
+
* Think about what to do with "valOf(Int32.minInt) div ~1" and friends.
  (Currently the behavior is inconsistent both across architectures and
  wrt. the draft Basis spec.)
+
* Word8 should eventually be handled natively, too.
+
* There seems to be one serious bug in mltree-gen.sml.  It appears, though,
  as if there currently is no execution path that could trigger it in
  SML/NJ.  (The assumptions underlying functions arith and promotable do not
  hold for things like multiplication and division.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/03/27]::
+
Added support for all four division operations (ML's div, mod, quot,
and rem) to MLRISC.  In the course of doing so, I also rationalized
the naming (no more annoying switch-around of DIV and QUOT), by
parameterizing the operation by div_rounding_mode (which can be either
DIV_TO_ZERO or DIV_TO_NEGINF).
+
The generic MLTreeGen functor takes care of compiling all four
operations down to only round-to-zero div.
+
Missing pieces:
+
  * Doing something smarter than relying on MLTreeGen on architectures
    like, _e.g._, the x86 where hardware division delivers both quotient and
    remainder at the same time.  With this, the implementation of the
    round-to-neginf operations could be further streamlined.
+
  * Remove inlining support for div/mod/rem from the frontend and replace it
    with primops that get carried through to the backend.  Do this for all
    int and word types.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/03/25]::
+
I improved (hopefully without breaking them) the implementation of Int.div,
Int.mod, and Int.rem.   For this, the code in translate.sml now takes
advantage of the following observations:
+
  Let  q = x quot y      r = x rem y
       d = x div  y      m = x mod y
+
where "quot" is the round-to-zero version of integer division that
hardware usually provides.  Then we have:
+
     r = x - q * y        where neither the * nor the - will overflow
     d = if q >= 0 orelse x = q * y then q else q - 1
                          where neither the * nor the - will overflow
     m = if q >= 0 orelse r = 0 then r else r + y
                          where the + will not overflow
+
This results in substantial simplification of the generated code.
The following table shows the number of CFG nodes and edges generated
for
        fun f (x, y) = x OPER y
        (* with OPER \in div, mod, quot, rem *)
+
+

1. Changes to FLINT primops:
+
[source,sml]
------------
    (* make a call to a C-function;
     * The primop carries C function prototype information and specifies
     * which of its (ML-) arguments are floating point. C prototype
     * information is for use by the backend, ML information is for
     * use by the CPS converter. *)
  | RAW_CCALL of { c_proto: CTypes.c_proto,
                   ml_args: ccall_type list,
                   ml_res_opt: ccall_type option,
                   reentrant : bool
                 } option
   (* Allocate uninitialized storage on the heap.
    * The record is meant to hold short-lived C objects, _i.e._, they
    * are not ML pointers.  With the tag, the representation is
    * the same as RECORD with tag tag_raw32 (sz=4), or tag_fblock (sz=8)
    *)
  | RAW_RECORD of {tag:bool,sz:int}
  and ccall_type = CCALL_INT32 | CCALL_REAL64 | CCALL_ML_PTR
------------

2.  These CPS primops are now overloaded:
+
[source,sml]
------------
       rawload of {kind:numkind}
       rawstore of {kind:numkind}
------------
+
The one argument form is:
+
[source,sml]
------------
         rawload {kind} address
------------
+
The two argument form is:
+
[source,sml]
------------
         rawload {kind} [ml object, byte-offset]
------------
+
3. RAW_CCALL/RCC now takes two extra arguments:
+
     a. The first is whether the C call is reentrant, _i.e._, whether
        ML state should be saved and restored.
     b. The second argument is a string argument specifying the name of
        library and the C function.
+
These things are currently not handled in the code generator, yet.
+
4. In CProto,
+
An encoding type of "bool" means "ml object" and is mapped into
C prototype of PTR.  Note that "bool" is different than "string",
even though "string" is also mapped into PTR, because "bool"
is assigned an CPS type of BOGt, while "string" is assigned INT32t.
+
5. Pickler/unpicker
+
Changed to handle `RAW_RECORD` and newest `RAW_CCALL`
+
6. MLRiscGen,
+
a. Changed to handle the new rawload/rawstore/rawrecord operators.
b. Code for handling C Calls has been moved to a new module CPSCCalls,
   in the file `CodeGen/cpscompile/cps-c-calls.sml`
+
7. Added the conditional move operator
+
[source,sml]
------------
         condmove of branch
------------
+
to cps.  Generation of this is still buggy so it is currently
disabled.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/03/22]::
+
Implemented the Ball-Larus branch prediction-heuristics, and
incorporated graphical viewers for control flow graphs.
+
*Ball-Larus Heuristics:*
+
See the file compiler/CodeGen/cpscompile/cpsBranchProb.sml.
+
By design it uses the Dempster-Shafer theory for combining
probabilities.  For example, in the function:
+
    fun f(n,acc) = if n = 0 then acc else f(n-1, n*acc)
+
the ball-larus heuristics predicts that the n=0 is unlikely
(OH-heuristic), and the 'then' branch is unlikely because of the
RH-heuristic -- giving the 'then' branch an even lower combined
probability using the Dempster-Shafer theory.
+
Finally, John Reppy's loop analysis in MLRISC, further lowers the
probability of the 'then' branch because of the loop in the else
branch.
+
+
*Graphical Viewing:*
+
I merely plugged in Allen's graphical viewers into the compiler. The
additional code is not much. At the top level, saying:
+
	Control.MLRISC.getFlag "cfg-graphical-view" := true;
+
will display the graphical view of the control flow graph just before
back-patching.  daVinci must be in your path for this to work. If
daVinci is not available, then the default viewer can be changed
using:
+
	Control.MLRISC.getString "viewer"
+
which can be set to "dot" or "vcg" for the corresponding viewers. Of
course, these viewers must be in your path.
+
The above will display the compilation unit at the level of clusters,
many of which are small, boring, and un-interesting. Also setting:
+
	Control.MLRISC.getInt "cfg-graphical-view_size"
+
will display clusters that are larger than the value set by the above.

+
Fixed a potential problem in cfg edge splitting.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/03/21]::
+
--
  1. Recoded the buggy parts of x86-fp.
+
     a. All the block reordering code has been removed.
        We now depend on the block placement phases to do this work.
+
     b. Critical edge splitting code has been simplified and moved into the
        CFG modules, as where they belong.
+
     Both of these were quite buggy and complex.  The code is now much, much
     simpler.
+
  2. X86 backend.
+
     a. Added instructions for 64-bit support.  Instruction selection for
        64-bit has not been committed, however, since that
        requires changes to MLTREE which haven't been approved by
        Lal and John.
+
     b. Added support for FUCOMI and FUCOMIP when generating code for
        PentiumPro and above.  We only generate these instructions in
        the fast-fp mode.
+
     c. Added cases for JP and JNP in X86FreqProps.
+
  3. CFG
+
     CFG now has a bunch of methods for edge splitting and merging.
+
  4. Machine description.
+
     John's simplification of MLTREE_BASIS.fcond broke a few machine
     description things:
+
     rtl-build.{sig,sml} and hppa.mdl fixed.
+
     NOTE: the machine description stuff in the repository is still broken.
           Again, I can't put my fixes in because that involves
           changes to MLTREE.

Implemented Knuth-Morris-Pratt string matching in PreString and used
it for String.isSubstring, Substring.isSubstring, and
Substring.position.
+
(Might need some stress-testing.  Simple examples worked fine.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/03/19]::
+
Added a structure C.W and functions convert/Ptr.convert to ml-nlffi-lib.
+
This implements a generic mechanism for changing constness qualifiers
anywhere within big C types without resorting to outright "casts".
(So far, functions such as C.rw/C.ro or C.Ptr.rw/C.Ptr.ro only let you
modify the constness at the outermost level.)
The implementation of "convert" is based on the idea of "witness"
values -- values that are not used by the operation but whose types
"testify" to their applicability.  On the implementation side, "convert"
is simply a projection (returning its second curried argument).  With
cross-module inlining, it should not result in any machine code being
generated.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/03/15]::
+
Provided (preliminary?) implementations for
+
  {String,Substring}.{concatWith,isSuffix,isSubstring}
+
and
+
  Substring.full
+
Those are in the Basis spec but they were missing in SML/NJ.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/03/14]::
+
*Controls:*
+
1. Factored out the recently-added Controls : CONTROLS stuff and put
   it into its own library $/controls-lib.cm.  The source tree for
   this is under src/smlnj-lib/Controls.
+
2. Changed the names of types and functions in this interface, so they
   make a bit more "sense":
+
      module -> registry
      'a registry -> 'a group
+
3. The interface now deals in ref cells only.  The getter/setter interface
   is (mostly) gone.
+
4. Added a function that lets one register an already-existing ref cell.
+
5. Made the corresponding modifications to the rest of the code so that
   everything compiles again.
+
6. Changed the implementation of Controls.MLRISC back to something closer
   to the original.  In particular, this module (and therefore MLRISC)
   does not depend on Controls.  There now is some link-time code in
   int-sys.sml that registers the MLRISC controls with the Controls
   module.
+
*CM:*
+
  * One can now specify the lambda-split aggressiveness in init.cmi.

//====================================================================
== Version 110.39.2; 2002/03/12


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/03/12]::
+
Yet another version number bump (because of small changes to the
binfile format).  Version number is now 110.39.2.  NEW BOOTFILES!
+
Changes:
+
  The new pid generation scheme described a few weeks ago was overly
  complicated.  I implemented a new mechanism that is simpler and
  provides a bit more "stability":  Once CM has seen a compilation
  unit, it keeps its identity constant (as long as you do not delete
  those crucial CM/GUID/* files).  This means that when you change
  an interface, compile, then go back to the old interface, and
  compile again, you arrive at the original pid.
+
  There now also is a mechanism that instructs CM to use the plain
  environment hash as a module's pid (effectively making its GUID
  the empty string).  For this, "noguid" must be specified as an
  option to the .sml file in question within its .cm file.
  This is most useful for code that is being generated by tools such
  as ml-nlffigen (because during development programmers tend to
  erase the tool's entire output directory tree including CM's cached
  GUIDs).  "noguid" is somewhat dangerous (since it can be used to locally
  revert to the old, broken behavior of SML/NJ, but in specific cases
  where there is no danger of interface confusion, its use is ok
  (I think).
+
  ml-nlffigen by default generates "noguid" annotations.  They can be
  turned off by specifying -guid in its command line.

[2002/03/12]::
+
Integrated jump chaining and static block frequency into the
compiler. More details and numbers later.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Lal George]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/03/11]::
+
Tested the jump chain elimination on all architectures (except the
hppa).  This is on by default right now and is profitable for the
alpha and x86, however, it may not be profitable for the sparc and ppc
when compiling the compiler.
+
The gc test will typically jump to a label at the end of the cluster,
where there is another jump to an external cluster containing the actual
code to invoke gc. This is to allow factoring of common gc invocation
sequences. That is to say, we generate:
+
	f:
	   testgc
	   ja	L1	% jump if above to L1
+
	L1:
	   jmp L2
+
+
After jump chain elimination the 'ja L1' instructions is converted to
'ja L2'. On the sparc and ppc, many of the 'ja L2' instructions may end
up being implemented in their long form (if L2 is far away) using:
+
	jbe	L3	% jump if below or equal to L3
        jmp 	L2
     L3:
	...
+
+
For large compilation units L2  may be far away.

   Bug fixes for CMOVcc on x86.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/03/07]::
+
This is a very large but mostly boring patch which makes (almost)
every tuneable compiler knob (_i.e._, pretty much everything under
Control.* plus a few other things) configurable via both the command
line and environment variables in the style CM did its configuration
until now.
+
Try starting sml with '-h' (or, if you are brave, '-H')
+
To this end, I added a structure Controls : CONTROLS to smlnj-lib.cm which
implements the underlying generic mechanism.
+
The interface to some of the existing such facilities has changed somewhat.
For example, the MLRiscControl module now provides mkFoo instead of getFoo.
(The getFoo interface is still there for backward-compatibility, but its
use is deprecated.)
+
The *ml-build* script passes -Cxxx=yyy command-line arguments through so
that one can now twiddle the compiler settings when using this "batch"
compiler.
+
TODO items:
+
We should go through and throw out all controls that are no longer
connected to anything.  Moreover, we should go through and provide
meaningful (and correct!) documentation strings for those controls
that still are connected.
+
Currently, multiple calls to Controls.new are accepted (only the first
has any effect).  Eventually we should make sure that every control
is being made (via Controls.new) exactly once.  Future access can then
be done using Controls.acc.
+
Finally, it would probably be a good idea to use the getter-setter
interface to controls rather than ref cells.  For the time being, both
styles are provided by the Controls module, but getter-setter pairs are
better if thread-safety is of any concern because they can be wrapped.
+
*****************************************
+
One bug fix: The function blockPlacement in three of the MLRISC
backpatch files used to be hard-wired to one of two possibilities at
link time (according to the value of the placementFlag).  But (I
think) it should rather sense the flag every time.
+
*****************************************
+
Other assorted changes (by other people who did not supply a HISTORY entry):
+
1. the cross-module inliner now works much better (Monnier)
2. representation of weights, frequencies, and probabilities in MLRISC
   changed in preparation of using those for weighted block placement
   (Reppy, George)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/03/07]::
+
Tested the weighted block placement optimization on all architectures
(except the hppa) using AMPL to generate the block and edge frequencies.
Changes were required in the machine properties to correctly
categorize trap instructions. There is an MLRISC flag
"weighted-block-placement" that can be used to enable weighted block
placement, but this will be ineffective without block/edge
frequencies (coming soon).
+
+
owner:smlnj.org[Lal George]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/03/05]::
+
In order to support the block placement optimization, a new cluster
is generated as the very first cluster (called the linkage cluster).
It contains a single jump to the 'real' entry point for the compilation
unit. Block placement has no effect on the linkage cluster itself, but
all the other clusters  have full freedom in the manner in which they
reorder blocks or functions.
+
On the x86 the typical linkage code that is generated is:
   ----------------------
	.align 2
   L0:
        addl    $L1-L0, 72(%esp)
        jmp     L1
+
+
        .align  2
   L1:
   ----------------------
+
72(%esp) is the memory location for the stdlink register. This
must contain the address of the CPS function being called. In the
above example, it contains the address of  L0; before
calling L1 (the real entry point for the compilation unit), it
must contain the address for L1, and hence
+
	addl $L1-L0, 72(%esp)
+
I have tested this on all architectures except the hppa.The increase
in code size is of course negligible

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/02/26]::
+
1. Fixed a minor bug in CM's "noweb" tool:
   If numbering is turned off, then truly don't number (_i.e._, do not
   supply the -L option to noweb).  The previous behavior was to supply
   -L'' -- which caused noweb to use the "default" line numbering scheme.
   Thanks to Chris Richards for pointing this out (and supplying the fix).
+
2. Once again, I reworked some aspects of the FFI:
+
   A. The incomplete/complete type business:
+
   - Signatures POINTER_TO_INCOMPLETE_TYPE and accompanying functors are
     gone!
   - ML types representing an incomplete type are now *equal* to
     ML types representing their corresponding complete types (just like
     in C).  This is still safe because ml-nlffigen will not generate
     RTTI for incomplete types, nor will it generate functions that
     require access to such RTTI.   But when ML code generated from both
     incomplete and complete versions of the C type meet, the ML types
     are trivially interoperable.
+
     NOTE:  These changes restore the full generality of the translation
     (which was previously lost when I eliminated functorization)!
+
   B. Enum types:
+
   - Structure C now has a type constructor "enum" that is similar to
     how the "su" constructor works.  However, "enum" is not a phantom
     type because each "T enum" has values (and is isomorphic to
     MLRep.Signed.int).
   - There are generic access operations for enum objects (using
     MLRep.Signed.int).
   - ml-nlffigen will generate a structure E_foo for each "enum foo".
     * The structure contains the definition of type "mlrep" (the ML-side
     representation type of the enum).  Normally, mlrep is the same
     as "MLRep.Signed.int", but if ml-nlffigen was invoked with "-ec",
     then mlrep will be defined as a datatype -- thus facilitating
     pattern matching on mlrep values.
     ("-ec" will be suppressed if there are duplicate values in an
      enumeration.)
     * Constructors ("-ec") or values (no "-ec") e_xxx of type mlrep
     will be generated for each C enum constant xxx.
     * Conversion functions m2i and i2m convert between mlrep and
     MLRep.Signed.int.  (Without "-ec", these functions are identities.)
     * Coversion functions c and ml convert between mlrep and "tag enum".
     * Access functions (get/set) fetch and store mlrep values.
   - By default (unless ml-nlffigen was invoked with "-nocollect"), unnamed
     enumerations are merged into one single enumeration represented by
     structure E_'.

This is a new implementation of the CPS spill phase.
The new phase is in the new file compiler/CodeGen/cpscompile/spill-new.sml
In case of problems, replace it with the old file spill.sml
+
The current compiler runs into some serious performance problems when
constructing a large record.  This can happen when we try to compile a
structure with many items.  Even a very simple structure like the following
makes the compiler slow down.
+
[source,sml]

    structure Foo = struct
       val x_1 = 0w1 : Word32.int
       val x_2 = 0w2 : Word32.int

+
As you can see the old cps spill module suffers from some serious
performance problem.  But since I cannot decipher the old code fully,
instead of patching the problems up, I'm reimplementing it
with a different algorithm.  The new code is more modular,
smaller when compiled, and substantially faster
(O(n log n) time and O(n) space).  Timing of the new spill module:
+
4000  CPS 100 spill                           0.02u  0.00s  0.00g
      MLRISC ra                               0.25u  0.02s  0.15g
         (spills=1 reloads=3)
      TOTAL                                   7.74u  0.34s  1.62g
+
Implementation details:
+
As far as I can tell, the purpose of the CPS spill module is to make sure the
number of live variables at any program point (the bandwidth)
does not exceed a certain limit, which is determined by the
size of the spill area.
+
When the bandwidth is too large, we decrease the register pressure by
packing live variables into spill records.  How we achieve this is
completely different than what we did in the old code.
+
First, there is something about the MLRiscGen code generator
that we should be aware of:
+
*MLRiscGen performs code motion!*
+
   In particular, it will move floating point computations and
   address computations involving only the heap pointer to
   their use sites (if there is only a single use).
   What this means is that if we have a CPS record construction
   statement
+
[source,sml]
------------
       RECORD(k,vl,w,e)
------------
+
   we should never count the new record address w as live if w
   has only one use (which is often the case).
+
   We should do something similar to floating point, but the transformation
   there is much more complex, so I won't deal with that.
+
Secondly, there are now two new cps primops at our disposal:
+
--
 1. rawrecord of record_kind option
    This pure operator allocates some uninitialized storage from the heap.
    There are two forms:
+
     rawrecord NONE [INT n]  allocates a tagless record of length n
     rawrecord (SOME rk) [INT n] allocates a tagged record of length n
                                 and initializes the tag.
+
 2. rawupdate of cty
      rawupdate cty (v,i,x)
      Assigns to x to the ith component of record v.
      The storelist is not updated.
--
+
We use these new primops for both spilling and increment record construction.
+
--
 1. Spilling.
+
    This is implemented with a linear scan algorithm (but generalized
    to trees).  The algorithm will create a single spill record at the
    beginning of the cps function and use rawupdate to spill to it,
    and SELECT or SELp to reload from it.  So both spills and reloads
    are fine-grain operations.  In contrast, in the old algorithm
    "spills" have to be bundled together in records.
+
    Ideally, we should sink the spill record construction to where
    it is needed.  We can even split the spill record into multiple ones
    at the places where they are needed.  But CPS is not a good
    representation for global code motion, so I'll keep it simple and
    am not attempting this.
+
 2. Incremental record construction (aka record splitting).
+
    Long records with many component values which are simulatenously live
    (recall that single use record addresses are not considered to
     be live) are constructed with rawrecord and rawupdate.
    We allocate space on the heap with rawrecord first, then gradually
    fill it in with rawupdate.  This is the technique suggested to me
    by Matthias.
+
    Some restrictions on when this is applicable:
    a. It is not a VECTOR record.  The code generator currently does not handle
       this case. VECTOR record uses double indirection like arrays.
    b. All the record component values are defined in the same "basic block"
       as the record constructor.  This is to prevent speculative
       record construction.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/02/19]::
+
A wild mix of changes, some minor, some major:
+
--
* All C FFI-related libraries are now anchored under $c:
    $/c.cm      --> $c/c.cm
    $/c-int.cm  --> $c/internals/c-int.cm
    $/memory.cm --> $c/memory/memory.cm
+
* "make" tool (in CM) now treats its argument pathname slightly
  differently:
    1. If the native expansion is an absolute name, then before invoking
       the "make" command on it, CM will apply OS.Path.mkRelative
       (with relativeTo = OS.FileSys.getDir()) to it.
    2. The argument will be passed through to subsequent phases of CM
       processing without "going native".  In particular, if the argument
       was an anchored path, then "make" will not lose track of that anchor.
+
* Compiler backends now "know" their respective C calling conventions
  instead of having to be told about it by ml-nlffigen.  This relieves
  ml-nlffigen from one of its burdens.
+
* The X86Backend has been split into X86CCallBackend and X86StdCallBackend.
+
* Export C_DEBUG and C_Debug from $c/c.cm.
+
* C type encoding in ml-nlffi-lib has been improved to model the conceptual
  subtyping relationship between incomplete pointers and their complete
  counterparts.  For this, ('t, 'c) ptr has been changed to 'o ptr --
  with the convention of instantiating 'o with ('t, 'c) obj whenever
  the pointer target type is complete.  In the incomplete case, 'o
  will be instantiated with some "'c iobj" -- a type obtained by
  using one of the functors PointerToIncompleteType or PointerToCompleteType.
+
  Operations that work on both incomplete and complete pointer types are
  typed as taking an 'o ptr while operations that require the target to
  be known are typed as taking some ('t, 'c) obj ptr.
+
  voidptr is now a bit "more concrete", namely "type voidptr = void ptr'"
  where void is an eqtype without any values.  This makes it possible
  to work on voidptr values using functions meant to operate on light
  incomplete pointers.
+
* As a result of the above, signature POINTER_TO_INCOMPLETE_TYPE has
  been vastly simplified.

//====================================================================
== Version 110.39; 2002/02/15


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/02/15]::
+
Added EnvRef.listBoundSymbols and CM.State.showBindings.  Especially
the latter can be useful for exploring what bindings are available at
the interactive prompt.  (The first function returns only the list
of symbols that are really bound, the second prints those but also the
ones that CM's autoloading mechanism knows about.)

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/02/15]::
+
Two improvements to ml-nlffigen:
+
  1. Write files only if they do not exist or if their current contents
     do not coincide with what's being written.  (That is, avoid messing
     with the time stamps unless absolutely necessary.)
+
  2. Implement a "repository" mechanism for generated files related
     to "incomplete pointer types".   See the README file for details.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/02/14]::

Fixed the MLRISC bug sent by Markus Wenzel regarding the compilation
of Isabelle on the x86.
+
From Allen:
+
* I've found the problem:
+
     in ra-core.sml, I use the counter "blocked" to keep track of the
     true number of elements in the freeze queue.  When the counter goes
     to zero, I skip examining the queue.  But I've messed up the
     bookkeeping in combine():
+
[source,sml]
------------
         else ();
         case !ucol of
           PSEUDO => (if !cntv > 0 then
                 (if !cntu > 0 then blocked := !blocked - 1 else ();
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                  moveu := mergeMoveList(!movev, !moveu)
                 )
              else ();
------------
+
     combine() is called to coalesce two nodes u and v.
     I think I was thinking that if the move counts of u and v are both
     greater than zero then after they are coalesced then one node is
     removed from the freeze queue.  Apparently I was thinking that
     both u and v are of low degree, but that's clearly not necessarily true.
+
+
* 02/12/2002:
+
    Here's the patch.  HOL now compiles.
+
    I don't know how this impact on performance (compile
    time or runtime).  This bug caused the RA (especially on the x86)
    to go thru the potential spill phase when there are still nodes on the
    freeze queue.

[2002/02/13]::

[2002/02/13]::
+
--
. More tweaks to ml-nlffigen:
+
   - better internal datastructures (resulting in slight speedup)
   - "-match" option requires exact match
   - "localized" gensym counters (untagged structs/unions nested within
     other structs/unions or within typedefs get a fresh counter; their
     tag will be prefixed by a concatenation of their parents' tags)
   - bug fixes (related to calculation of transitive closure of types
     to be included in the output)
+
. Minor Basis updates:
+
   - added implementations for List.collate and Option.app
--
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/02/11]::
+
Added a "-gensym" option to command line of ml-nlffigen.  This can be
used to specify a "stem" -- a string that is inserted in all "gensym'd"
names (ML structure names that correspond to unnamed C structs, unions,
and enums), so that separate runs of ml-nlffigen do not clash.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/02/11]::
+
A quick fix for a problem with GenSML (in the pgraph-util library):
Make generation of toplevel "local" optional.  (Strictly speaking,
signature definitions within "local" are not legal SML.)

== Version 110.38.1; 2002/02/08


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/02/08]::
+
--
. The installer (config/install.sh) has gotten smarter:
+
--
     - Configuration options are a bit easier to specify now
       (in config/targets).
     - Bug in recognizing .tar.bz2 files fixed.
     - Installer automatically resolves dependencies between
       configuration options (_e.g._, if you ask for eXene, you will
       also get cml -- regardless whether you asked for it or not).
     - Installer can run in "quieter mode" by setting the environment
       variable INSTALL_QUIETLY to "true".  "Quieter" does not mean
       "completely silent", though.
     - Build HashCons library as part of smlnj-lib.
--
+
. A new scheme for assigning persistent identifiers to compilation
   units (and, by extension, to types etc.) has been put into place.
   This fixes a long-standing bug where types and even dynamic values
   can get internally confused, thereby compromising type safety
   (abstraction) and dynamic correctness.  See
     http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/blume/pid-confusion.tgz[]
   for an example of how things could go wrong until now.
+
   The downside of the new scheme is that pids are not quite as
   persistent as they used to be: CM will generate a fresh pid
   for every compilation unit that it thinks it sees for the first
   time.  That means that if you compile starting from a clean, fresh
   source tree at two different times, you end up with different
   binaries.
+
   Cutoff recompilation, however, has not been compromised because
   CM keeps pid information in special caches between runs.

[2002/02/07]::
+
Compilers that generate assembly code may produce  global labels
whose value is resolved at link time. The various peephole optimization
modules did not take this in account.
+
TODO. The Labels.addrOf function should really return an option
type so that clients are forced to deal with this issue, rather
than an exception being raised.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Lal George]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/02/06]::
+
--
. A bug fix from Allen:
    A typo causes extra `fstp %st(0)` instructions to be generated at compensation
    edges, which might cause stack underflow traps at runtime.  This
    occurs in fft where there are extraneous fstps right before the `into`
    trap instruction (in this case they are harmless since none of the
    integers overflow.)
. Pulled out various utility modules that were embedded in the modules
   of the register allocator. I need these modules for other purposes, but
   they are not complete enough to put into a library (just yet).

      not set / "unknown"      --> automatic detection (script tries wget,
                                   curl, and lynx)
      "wget" / "curl" / "lynx" --> use the specified program (script "knows"
                                   how to properly invoke them)
      other                    --> use $URLGETTER directly, it must take
                                   precisely two command-line arguments
                                   (source URL and destination file name)

owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/01/21]::
+
Another day of fiddling with the FFI...
+
1. Bug fix/workaround:  CKIT does not complain about negative array
   dimensions, so ml-nlffigen has to guard itself against this possibility.
   (Otherwise a negative dimension would send it into an infinite loop.)
+
2. Some of the abstract types (light objects, light pointers, most "base"
   types) in structure C are now eqtypes.
+
3. Added constructors and test functions for NULL function pointers.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/01/18]::

Maybe we christen this to be 110.38?
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/01/18]::
+
Today's FFI fiddling:
+
  - Provided a structure CGetSet with "convenient" versions of C.Get.* and
    C.Set.* that use concrete (MLRep.*) arguments and results instead
    of abstract ones.
+
  - Provided word-style bit operations etc. for "int" representation
    types in MLRep.S<Foo>Bitops where <Foo> ranges over Char, Int, Short,
    and Long.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/01/18]::
+
Now that x86-fast-fp seems to be working, I turned it back on again
by default.  (Seems to work fine now, even with the FFI.)
+
Other than that, I added some documentation about the FFI to
src/ml-nlffigen/README and updated the FFI test examples in
src/ml-nlffi-lib/Tests/*.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2002/01/17]::
+
   1. Fixed a problem with handling return fp values when x86's fast fp
      mode is turned on.
+
   2. Minor pretty printing fix for cellset.  Print %st(0) as %st(0) instead
      of %f32.
+

More fiddling with the FFI interface:
+
 - Make constness 'c instead of rw wherever possible.  This eliminates
   the need for certain explicit coercions.  (However, due to ML's
   value polymorphism, there will still be many cases where explicit
   coercions are necessary.  Phantom types are not the whole answer
   to modeling a subtyping relationship in ML.)
+
 - ro/rw coersions for pointers added.  (Avoids the detour through */&.)
+
 - "printf" test example added to src/ml-nlffi-lib/Tests.  (Demonstrates
   clumsy workaround for varargs problem.)

[2001/12/06]::
+
Changed the representation of instructions from being fully abstract
to being partially concrete. That is to say:
+
  from
	type instruction
+
  to
	type instr				(* machine instruction *)
+
	datatype instruction =
	    LIVE of {regs: C.cellset, spilled: C.cellset}
          | KILL of {regs: C.cellset, spilled: C.cellset}
          | COPYXXX of {k: CB.cellkind, dst: CB.cell list, src: CB.cell list}
          | ANNOTATION of {i: instruction, a: Annotations.annotation}
          | INSTR of instr
+
This makes the handling of certain special instructions that appear on
all architectures easier and uniform.
+
LIVE and KILL say that a list of registers are live or killed at the
program point where they appear. No spill code is generated when an
element of the 'regs' field is spilled, but the register is moved to
the 'spilled' (which is present, more for debugging than anything else).
+
LIVE replaces the (now deprecated) DEFFREG instruction on the alpha.
We used to generate:
+
	DEFFREG f1
	f1 := f2 + f3
        trapb
+
but now generate:
+
	f1 := f2 + f3
	trapb
	LIVE {regs=[f1,f2,f3], spilled=[]}
+
Furthermore, the DEFFREG (hack) required that all floating point instruction
use all registers mentioned in the instruction. Therefore f1 := f2 + f3,
defines f1 and uses [f1,f2,f3]! This hack is no longer required resulting
in a cleaner alpha implementation. (Hopefully, intel will not get rid of
this architecture).
+
COPYXXX is intended to replace the parallel COPY and FCOPY  available on
all the architectures. This will result in further simplification of the
register allocator that must be aware of them for coalescing purposes, and
will also simplify certain aspects of the machine description that provides
callbacks related to parallel copies.
+
ANNOTATION should be obvious, and now INSTR represents the honest to God
machine instruction set!
+
The <arch>/instructions/<arch>Instr.sml files define certain utility
functions for making porting easier -- essentially converting upper case
to lower case. All machine instructions (of type instr) are in upper case,
and the lower case form generates an MLRISC instruction. For example on
the alpha we have:
+
  datatype instr =
     LDA of {r:cell, b:cell, d:operand}
   | ...
+
  val lda : {r:cell, b:cell, d:operand} -> instruction
    ...
+
where lda is just (INSTR o LDA), etc.

Note: I removed the original tag "Release_110_37" from this commit
      because we found a serious bug in all non-x86 backends.
      - Matthias
+
1. Modifications to the SML/NJ code generator and to the runtime system
   so that code object name strings are directly inserted into code
   objects at code generation time.  The only business the runtime system
   has with this is now to read the name strings on occasions.
   (The encoding of the name string has also changed somewhat.)
+
2. CM now implements a simple "set calculus" for specifying export lists.
   In particular, it is now possible to refer to the export lists of
   other libraries/groups/sources and form unions as well as differences.
   See the latest CM manual for details.
+
3. An separate notion of "proxy" libraries has again be eliminated from
   CM's model.  (Proxy libraries are now simply a special case of using
   the export list calculus.)
+
4. Some of the existing libraries now take advantage of the new set
   calculus.
   (Notice that not all libraries have been converted because some
   of the existing .cm-files are supposed to be backward compatible
   with 110.0.x.)
+
5. Some cleanup in stand-alone programs.  (Don't use "exnMessage" -- use
   "General.exnMessage"!  The former relies on a certain hook to be
   initialized, and that often does not happen in the stand-alone case.)

  Fix for a backpatching bug reported by Allen.
+
  Because the boundary between short and long span-dependent
  instructions is +/- 128, there are an astounding number of
  span-dependent instructions whose size is over estimated.
+
  Allen came up with the idea of letting the size of span
  dependent instructions be non-monotonic, for a maxIter
  number of times, after which the size must be monotonically
  increasing.
+
  This table shows the number of span-dependent instructions
  whose size was over-estimated as a function of maxIter, for the
  file Parse/parse/ml.grm.sml:
+
     maxIter		# of instructions:
 	10			687
 	20			438
 	30			198
        40			  0
+
  In compiling the compiler, there is no significant difference in
  compilation speed between maxIter=10 and maxIter=40. Actually,
  my measurements showed that maxIter=40 was a tad faster than
  maxIter=10! Also 96% of the  files in the compiler reach a fix
  point within 13 iterations, so fixing maxIter at 40, while high,
  is okay.

!!!! NEW BOOTFILES !!!!
+
This is another round of reorganizing the compiler sources.  This
time the main goal was to factor out all the "instrumentation"
passes (for profiling and backtracing) into their own library.
The difficulty was to do it in such a way that it does not depend
on elaborate.cm but only on elabdata.cm.
+
Therefore there have been further changes to both elaborate.cm and
elabdata.cm -- more "generic" things have been moved from the former
to the latter.  As a result, I was forced to split the assignment
of numbers indicating "primtyc"s into two portions: SML-generic and
SML/NJ-specific.  Since it would have been awkward to maintain,
I bit the bullet and actually _changed_ the mapping between these
numbers and primtycs.  The bottom line of this is that you need
a new set of bin- and bootfiles.
+
I have built new bootfiles for all architectures, so doing a fresh
checkout and config/install.sh should be all you need.
+
The newly created library's name is
+
    $smlnj/viscomp/debugprof.cm
+
and its sources live under

    src/compiler/DebugProf

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/08/15]::
+
This is a first cut at reorganizing the CM libraries that make up the
core of the compiler.  The idea is to separate out pieces that could
be used independently by tools, _e.g._, the parser, the typechecker, etc.
+
The current status is a step in this direction, but it is not quite
satisfactory yet.  Expect more changes in the future.
+
Here is the current (new) organization...
+
    What used to be $smlnj/viscomp/core.cm is now divided into
    six CM libraries:
+
         $smlnj/viscomp/basics.cm
                       /parser.cm
                       /elabdata.cm
                       /elaborate.cm
                       /execute.cm
                       /core.cm
+
    The CM files for these libraries live under src/system/smlnj/viscomp.
    All these libraries are proxy libraries that contain precisely
    one CM library component.  Here are the locations of the components
    (all within the src/compiler tree):
+
         Basics/basics.cm
         Parse/parser.cm
         ElabData/elabdata.cm
         Elaborator/elaborate.cm
         Execution/execute.cm
         core.cm
+
     [This organization is the same that has been used already
     for a while for the architecture-specific parts of the visible
     compiler and for the old version of core.cm.]
+
     As you will notice, many source files have been moved from their
     respective original locations to a new home in one of the above
     subtrees.
+
     The division of labor between the new libraries is the following:
+
         basics.cm:
            - Simple, basic definitions that pertain to many (or all) of
              the other libraries.
         parser.cm:
            - The SML parser, producing output of type Ast.dec.
            - The type family for Ast is also defined and exported here.
         elabdata.cm:
            - The datatypes that describe input and output of the elaborator.
              This includes types, absyn, and static environments.
         elaborator.cm:
            - The SML/NJ type checker and elaborator.
              This maps an Ast.dec (with a given static environment) to
              an Absyn.dec (with a new static environment).
            - This libraries implements certain modules that used to be
              structures as functors (to remove dependencies on FLINT).
         execute.cm:
            - Everything having to do with executing binary code objects.
            - Dynamic environments.
         core.cm:
            - SML/NJ-specific instantiations of the elaborator and MLRISC.
            - Top-level modules.
            - FLINT (this should eventually become its own library)
+
Notes:
+
I am not 100% happy with the way I separated the elaborator (and its
data structures) from FLINT.  Two instances of the same problem:
+
    1. Data structures contain certain fields that carry FLINT-specific
       information.  I hacked around this using exn and the property list
       module from smlnj-lib.  But the fact that there are middle-end
       specific fields around at all is a bit annoying.
+
    2. The elaborator calculates certain FLINT-related information.  I tried
       to make this as abstract as I could using functorization, but, again,
       the fact that the elaborator has to perform calculations on behalf
       of the middle-end at all is not nice.
+
    3. Having to used exn and property lists is unfortunate because it
       weakens type checking.  The other alternative (parameterizing
       nearly *everything*) is not appealing, though.
+
I removed the "rebinding =" warning hack because due to the new organization
it was awkward to maintain it.  As a result, the compiler now issues some of
these warnings when compiling init.cmi during bootstrap compilation. On
the plus side, you also get a warning when you do, for example:
   val op = = Int32.+
which was not the case up to now.
+
I placed "assign" and "deref" into the _Core structure so that the
code that deals with the "lazy" keyword can find them there.  This
removes the need for having access to the primitive environment
during elaboration.

I have dramatically simplified the interface for CELLS in MLRISC.
+
In summary, the cells interface is broken up into three parts:
--
1. `CellsBasis : CELLS_BASIS`
+
`CellsBasis` is a top level structure and common for all
architectures.  it contains the definitions of basic datatypes
and utility  functions over these types.
+
2. `functor Cells() : CELLS`
+
Cells generates an interface for CELLS that incorporates the
specific resources on the target architecture, such as the
presence of special register classes, their number and size,
and various useful substructures.
+
3. __<ARCH>__++CELLS++
+
_e.g._, `SparcCells: SPARCCELLS`
+
__<ARCH>__++CELLS++ usually contains additional bindings for special
registers  on the architecture, such as:
+
[source,sml]
------------
        val r0 : cell          (* register zero *)
        val y : cell           (* Y register *)
        val psr : cell         (* processor status register *)
        ...
------------
+
The structure returned by applying the Cells functor is opened
in this interface.
+
The main implication of all this is that the datatypes for cells is
split between `CellsBasis` and `CELLS` -- a fairly simple change for user
code.
+
In the old scheme the `CELLS` interface had a definitional binding of
the form:
+
[source,sml]
------------
        signature CELLS =
          sig
            structure CellsBasis = CellsBasis
            ...
          end
------------
+
With all the sharing constraints that goes on in MLRISC, this old
design  quickly leads to errors such as:
+
[source]
--------
        structure definition spec inside of sharing ...
--------
+
and appears to require an unacceptable amount of sharing and where
constraint hackery.
+
I think this error message (the interaction of definitional specs and
sharing) requires more explanation on our web page.

[2001/07/19]::
+
This update puts together a fairly extensive but straightforward change
to the way the libraries that implement the interactive system are
organized:
+
The biggest change is the elimination of structure `Compiler`.  As a
replacement for this structure, there is now a CM library
(known as `$smlnj/compiler.cm` or `$smlnj/compiler/current.cm`)
that exports all the substructures of the original `Compiler` structure
directly.  So instead of saying `Compiler.Foo.bar` one now simply
says `Foo.bar`.  (The CM libraries actually export a collection of
structures that is richer than the collection of substructures of
structure `Compiler`.)
+
To make the transition smooth, there is a separate library called
`$smlnj/compiler/compiler.cm` that puts together and exports the
original structure `Compiler` (or at least something very close to it).
+
There are five members of the original structure `Compiler`
that are not exported directly but which instead became members
of a new structure `Backend` (described by signature `BACKEND`).
These are:
+
[source,sml]
------------
	structure Profile  : PROFILE
	structure Compile  : COMPILE
	structure Interact : INTERACT
	structure Machine  : MACHINE

	val architecture : string
------------
+
Structure `Compiler.Version` has become structure `CompilerVersion`.
+
Cross-compilers for alpha32, hppa, ppc, sparc, and x86 are provided
by $smlnj/compiler/<arch>.cm where <arch> is alpha32, hppa, ppc, sparc,
or x86, respectively.
Each of these exports the same frontend structures that
$smlnj/compiler.cm exports.  But they do not have a structure Backend
and instead export some structure <Arch>Backend where <Arch> is Alpha32,
Hppa, PPC, Sparc, or X86, respectively.
+
Library $smlnj/compiler/all.cm exports the union of the exports of
$smlnj/compiler/<arch>.cm
+
There are no structures <Arch>Compiler anymore, use
$smlnj/compiler/<arch>.cm instead.
+
Library host-compiler-0.cm is gone.  Instead, the internal library
that instantiates CM is now called cm0.cm.  Selection of the host
compiler (backend) is no longer done here but. (Responsibility for it
now lies with $smlnj/compiler/current.cm.  This seems to be more
logical.)
+
Many individual files have been moved or renamed.  Some files have
been split into multiple files, and some "dead" files have been deleted.
+
Aside from these changes to library organization, there are also changes
to the way the code itself is organized:
+
Structure Binfile has been re-implemented in such a way that it no
longer needs any knowledge of the compiler.  It exclusively deals
with the details of binfile layout.  It no longer invokes the
compiler (for the purpose of creating new prospective binfile
content), and it no longer has any knowledge of how to interpret
pickles.
+
Structure `Compile` has been stripped down to the bare
essentials of compilation.  It no longer deals with linking/execution.
The interface has been cleaned up considerably.
+
Utility routines for dealing with linking and execution have been
moved into their own substructures.
+
(The ultimate goal of these changes is to provide a light-weight
binfile loader/linker (at least for, _e.g._, stable libraries) that
does not require CM or the compiler to be present.)
+
CM documentation has been updated to reflect the changes to library
organization.

== Version 110.34; 2001/07/10


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/07/09]::
+
I changed the handling of varargs in ml-nlffigen again:
The ellipsis ... will now simply be ignored (with an accompanying warning).
+
The immediate effect is that you can actually call a varargs function
from ML -- but you can't actually supply any arguments beyond the ones
specified explicitly.  (For example, you can call printf with its format
string, but you cannot pass additional arguments.)
+
This behavior is only marginally more useful than the one before, but
it has the advantage that a function or, more importantly, a function
type never gets dropped on the floor, thus avoiding follow-up problems with
other types that refer to the offending one.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/07/09]::
+
1. ckit-lib.cm now exports structure Error
2. ml-nlffigen reports occurences of "..." (_i.e._, varargs function types)
   with a warning accompanied by a source location.  Moreover, it
   merely skips the offending function or type and proceeds with the
   rest of its work.u  As a result, one can safely feed C code containing
   "..." to ml-nlffigen.
3. There are some internal improvements to CM, providing slightly
   more general string substitutions in the tools subsystem.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/06/27]::
+
Fixed a small bug in CM's handling of parallel compilation.
(You could observe the bug by Control-C-interrupting an ordinary
CMB.make or CM.stabilize and then attaching some compile servers.
The result was that all of a sudden the previously interrupted
compilation would continue on its own.  This was because of
an over-optimization: CM did not bother to clean out certain queues
when no servers were attached "anyway", resulting in the contents
of these queues to grab control when new servers did get attached.)
+
There is also another minor update to the CM manual.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/06/25]::
+
This update fixes a number of minor bugs in ml-nlffigen as reported by
Nick Carter <nbc@andrew.cmu.edu>.
+
  1. Silly but ok typedefs of the form "typedef void myvoid;" are now accepted.
  2. Default names for generated files are now derived from the name of
     the C file *without its directory*.  In particular, this causes generated
     files to be placed locally even if the C file is in some system directory.
  3. Default names for generated signatures and structures are also derived
     from the C file name without its directory.  This avoids silly things
     like "structure GL/GL".
     (Other silly names are still possible because ml-nlffigen does not do
      a thorough check of whether generated names are legal ML identifiers.
      When in doubt, use command line arguments to force particular names.)

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/06/15]::
+
Here is a short late-hour update related to Sparc c-calls:
+
 -- made handling of double-word arguments a bit smarter
+
 -- instruction selection phase tries to collapse certain clumsily
    constructed ML-Trees; typical example:
+
        ADD(ty,ADD(_,e,LI d1),LI d2)  ->  ADD(ty,e,LI(d1+d2))
+
    This currently has no further impact on SML/NJ since mlriscGen does
    not seem to generate such patterns in the first place, and c-calls
    (which did generate them in the beginning) has meanwhile been fixed
    so as to avoid them as well.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/06/15]::
+
The purpose of this update is to provide an implementation of NLFFI
on Sparc machines.
+
Here are the changes in detail:
+
   * src/MLRISC/sparc/c-calls/sparc-c-calls.sml is a new file containing
   the Sparc implementation of the c-calls API.
   * The Sparc backend of SML/NJ has been modified to uniformely use %fp
   for accessing the ML frame.  Thus, we have a real frame pointer and
   can freely modify %sp without need for an omit-frame-ptr phase.
   The vfp logic in src/compiler/CodeGen/* has been changed to accomodate
   this case.
   * ml-nlffigen has been taught to produce code for different architectures
   and calling conventions.
   * In a way similar to what was done in the x86 case, the Sparc
   backend uses its own specific extension to mltree.  (For example,
   it needs to be able to generate UNIMP instructions which are part
   of the calling convention.)
   * ml-nlffi-lib was reorganized to make it more modular (in particular,
   to make it easier to plug in new machine- and os-dependent parts).
+
There are some other fairly unrelated bug fixes and cleanups as well:
+
   * I further hacked the .cm files for MLRISC tools (like MDLGen) so
   that they properly share their libraries with existing SML/NJ libraries.
   * I fixed a minor cosmetic bug in CM, supressing certain spurious
   follow-up error messages.
   * Updates to CM/CMB documentation.
+
TODO items:
+
   * MLRISC should use a different register as its asmTemp on the Sparc.
     (The current %o2 is a really bad choice because it is part of the
     calling conventions, so things might interfere in unexpected ways.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/06/07]::
+
A number of internal changes related to C calls and calling conventions:
+
1. ML-Tree CALL statements now carry a "pops" field.  It indicates the
   number of bytes popped implicitly (by the callee).  In most cases
   this field is 0 but on x86/win32 it is some non-zero value.  This
   is information provided for the benefit of the "omit-frameptr" pass.
2. The CALL instruction on the x86 carries a similar "pops" field.
   The instruction selection phase copies its value from the ML-Tree
   CALL statement.
3. On all other architectures, the instruction selection phase checks
   whether "pops=0" and complains if not.
4. The c-calls implementation for x86 now accepts two calling conventions:
   "ccall" and "stdcall".  When "ccall" is selected, the caller cleans
   up after the call and pops is set to 0.  For "stdcall", the caller
   does nothing, leaving the cleanup to the callee; pops is set to
   the number of bytes that were pushed onto the stack.
5. The cproto decoder (compiler/Semant/types/cproto.sml) now can
   distinguish between "ccall" and "stdcall".
6. The UNIMP instruction has been added to the supported Sparc instruction
   set. (This is needed for implementing the official C calling convention
   on this architecture.)
7. I fixed some of the .cm files under src/MLRISC/Tools to make them
   work with the latest CM.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/06/05]::
+
1. The "lambdasplit" parameter for class "sml" in CM has been documented.
+
2. CM can now generate "index files".  These are human-readable files
   that list on a per-.cm-file basis each toplevel symbol defined or
   imported.  The location of the index file for
   <p>/<d>.cm is <p>/CM/INDEX/<d>.cm.
   To enable index-file generation, set CM.Control.generate_index to true
   or export an environment-symbol: export CM_GENERATE_INDEX=true.
+
   The CM manual has been updated accordingly.
+
3. I made some slight modifications to the c-calls API in MLRISC.
+
     a) There is now a callback to support saving/restoring of
        dedicated but caller-save registers around the actual call
        instruction.
     b) One can optionally specify a comment-annotation for the
        call instruction.
+
4. SML/NJ (mlriscGen.sml) uses this new API for the rawccall primop.
   (For example, the comment annotation shows the C prototype of
    the function being called.)
+

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/06/01]::
+
This is mostly a cleanup of MLFFI stuff:
+
   - some signature files have been put into a more exposed place
   - the ugly 'f type parameter is gone (simplifies types tremendously!)
   - ml-nlffigen changed accordingly
   - tutorial updated
+
Other changes:
+
   - author's affiliation in CM manual(s) updated
   - some more recognized keywords added to Allen's sml.sty

    CVS
  - fixed a small bug related to incomplete pointer types in
    ml-nlffigen
  - small cosmetic change to the ml-nlffi-lib's "arr" type constructor
    (it does not need the 'f type parameter)

== Version 110.33; 2001/05/23


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/05/22]::
+
Made install.sh use file config/targets.customized if it exists, falling
back to config/targets if it doesn't.  This way one can have a customized
version of the targets file without touching the "real thing", thus
eliminating the constant fear of accidentally checking something bogus
back into the CVS repository...  (File config/targets.customized must
not be added to the repository!)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/05/22]::
+
1. Bug fix in ml-nlffigen; now (hopefully) correctly handling
   struct returns.
2. Added src/ml-nlffi-lib/Doc/mini-tutorial.txt.  This is some very
   incomplete, preliminary documentation for NLFFI.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/05/14]::
+
Some bugs in install script fixed.
+
In addition to that I also made a slight change to the NLFFI API:
Functors generated by ml-nlffigen now take the dynamic library as a
straight functor argument, not as a suspended one.  (The original
functor code used to force the suspension right away anyway, so there
was nothing gained by this complication of the interface.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/05/11]::
+
I finally took the plunge and added my new FFI code to the main
repository.  For x86-linux it is now ready for prime-time.
+
There are two new subdirectories of "src":
+
  - ml-nlffi-lib:
       The utility library for programs using the FFI interface.
       Here is the implementation of $/c.cm and its associated low-level
       partners $/c-int.cm and $/memory.cm.
  - ml-nlffigen:
       A stand-alone program for generating ML glue code from C source
       code.
+
Building ml-nlffigen requires $/ckit-lib.cm.
+
The config/install.sh script has been updates to do the Right Thing
(hopefully).
+
Notice that the source tree for the C-Kit will not be put under "src"
but directly under the installation root directory.  (This is the
structure that currently exists on the CVS server when you check out
module "sml".)  Fortunately, config/install.sh knows about this oddity.
+
Bugs: No documentation yet.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/05/09]::
+
Fixed a bug in the accounting code in cpsopt/contract.sml.  (The
wrapper/unwrapper elimination did not decrement usage counts and some
dead variables got overlooked by the dead-up logic.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/05/08]::
+
Changes to implement the omit-frame-pointer optimization to support
raw C calls. For now, there is only support on the Intel x86, but
other architectures will follow as more experience is gained with this.
+
+
owner:smlnj.org[Lal George]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/05/07]::
+
I made into "proxy libraries" all libraries that qualify for such a
change.  (A qualifying library is a library that has another library or
groups as its sole member and repeats that member's export list
verbatim.  A proxy library avoids this repetition by omitting its export
list, effectively inheriting the list that its (only) member exports.
See the CM manual for more explanation.)
The main effect is that explicit export lists for these libraries
do not have to be kepts in sync, making maintenance a bit easier.
+
I also added copyright notices to many .cm-files.
+
Last but not least, I made a new set of bootfiles.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/05/04]::
+
1. John merged pending changes to $/smlnj-lib.cm
+
2. Allen's previous change accidentally backed out of one of Lal's
   earlier changes.  I undid this mistake (re-introducing Lal's change).
+
3. I used the new topOrder' function from graph-scc.sml (from $/smlnj-lib.cm)
   within the compiler where applicable.  There is some code simplification
   because of that.
+
4. The "split" phase (in FLINT) is now part of the default list of phases.
   Compiler.Control.LambdaSplitting.* can be used to globally control the
   lambda-splitting (cross-module-inlining) engine.  In addition to that,
   it can now also be controlled on a per-source basis: CM has been taught
   a new tool parameter applicable to ML source files.
+
   - To turn lambda-splitting off completely:
        local open Compiler.Control.LambdaSplitting in
            val _ = set Off
        end
   - To make "no lambda-splitting" the global default (but allow per-source
     overriding); this is the initial setting:
        local open Compiler.Control.LambdaSplitting in
            val _ = set (Default NONE)
        end
   - To make "lambda-splitting with aggressiveness a" the global default
     (and allow per-source overriding):
        local open Compiler.Control.LambdaSplitting in
            val _ = set (Default (SOME a))
        end
+
   - To turn lambda-splitting off for a given ML souce file (say: a.sml)
     write (in the respective .cm-file):
        a.sml (lambdasplitting:off)
   - To turn lambda-splitting for a.sml on with minimal aggressiveness:
        a.sml (lambdasplitting:on)
   - To turn lambda-splitting for a.sml on with aggressiveness <a> (where
     <a> is a decimal non-negative integer):
        a.sml (lambdasplitting:<a>)
   - To turn lambda-splitting for a.sml on with maximal aggressiveness:
        a.sml (lambdasplitting:infinity)
   - To use the global default for a.sml:
        a.sml (lambdasplitting:default)
     or simply
        a.sml

[2001/04/18]::

 - fixed two off-by-4 errors in the x86-specific c-calls implementation
   (this bug prevented structure arguments containing pointers from being
    passed correctly)
 - changed the raw-C-call code in mlriscGen.sml in such a way that
   structure arguments are represented as a pointer to the beginning
   of the structure (instead of having a series of synthesized arguments,
   one for each structure member)
+
 - made makeml script's verbosity level configurable via environment
   variable (MAKEML_VERBOSITY)
+
 - eliminated placeholder implementations for f32l, w16s, i16s, and f32s
   in rawmem-x86.sml; we are now using the real thing

[2001/03/19]::

Parallel make (using compile servers) now works again.
+
To this end, CM.stabilize and CMB.make have been modified to work in
two passes when compile servers are attached:
   1. Compile everything, do not perform stabilization; this pass
      uses compile servers
   2. Stabilize everything; this pass does not use compile servers
If there are no compile servers, the two passes are combined into one
(as before).  Splitting the passes increases the inherent parallelism
in the dependency graph because the entire graph including all
libraries is available at the same time.  This, in turn, improves
server utilization.  The downside is that the master process will
have to do some extra work after compilation is done (because for
technical reasons it must re-read all the binfiles during stabilization).

[2001/01/09]::

This is a fairly big patch, flushing out a large number of pending
changes that I made to my development copy over the last couple of days.
+
Of practical relevance at this moment is a workaround for a pickling
bug that Allen ran into the other day.  The cause of the bug itself is
still unknown and it might be hard to fix it properly, but the
workaround has some merits of its own (namely somewhat reducing pickling
overhead for certain libraries).  Therefore, I think this solution should
be satisfactory at this time.
+
The rest of the changes (_i.e._, the vast majority) has to do with my
ongoing efforts of providing direct support for C function calls from
ML.  At the moment there is a new primop "RAW_CCALL", typing magic
in types/cproto.sml (invoked from FLINT/trans/translate.sml), a new
case in the FLINT CPS datatype (RCC), changes to cps/convert.sml to
translate uses of RAW_CCALL into RCC, and changes to mlriscGen.sml to
handle RCC.
+
The last part (the changes to mlriscGen.sml) are still known to be
wrong on the x86 and not implemented on all other architectures.  But
the infrastructure is in place. I had to change a few functor
signatures in the backend to be able to route the CCalls interface
from MLRISC there, and I had to specialize the mltree type (on the
x86) to include the necessary extensions. (The extensions themselves
were already there and redy to go in MLRISC/x86).
+
Everything should be very happy as soon as someone helps me with
mlriscGen.sml...
+
In any case, nothing of this should matter to anyone as long as the
new primop is not being used (which is going to be the case unless you
find it where I hid it :). The rest of the compiler is completely
unaffected.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2001/01/05]::
+
Added some experimental support for work that I am doing right now.
These changes mostly concern added primops, but there is also a new
experimental C library in the runtime system (but currently not enabled
anywhere except on Linux/X86).
+
In the course of adding primops (and playing with them), I discovered that
Zhong's INL_PRIM hack (no type info for certain primops) was, in fact, badly
broken.  (Zhong was very right he labeled this stuff as "major gross hack".)
To recover, I made type information in INL_PRIM mandatory and changed
prim.sml as well as built-in.sml accordingly.  The InLine structure now
has complete, correct type information (_i.e._, no bottom types).
+
Since all these changes mean that we need new binfiles, I also bumped the
version number to 110.32.1.

- Version 110.31
+
owner:smlnj.org[Lal George]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/12/07]::
+
Major MLRISC internal changes.  Affect all clients.
Summary:
+
1.  Type CELLS.cell = int is now replaced by a datatype.
    As a result, the old regmap is now gone.  Almost all interfaces
    in MLRISC change as a consequence.
+
2.  A new brand version of machine description tool (v3.0) that generates
    modules expecting the new interface.  The old version is removed.
+
3.  The RA interface has been further abstracted into two new functors.
    RISC_RA and X86RA.  These functors have much simpler interfaces.
    [See also directory MLRISC/demo.]
+
4.  Some other new source->source code generation tools are available:
+
    a. MLRISC/Tools/RewriteGen -- generate rewriters from rules.
    b. MLRISC/Tools/WhereGen -- expands conditional pattern matching rules.
       I use this tool to generate the peephole optimizers---with the new
       cell type changes, peephole rules are becoming difficult to write
       without conditional pattern matching.
+
5.  More Intmap -> IntHashTable change.  Previous changes by Matthias didn't
    cover the entire MLRISC source tree so many things broke.
+
6.  CM files have been moved to the subdirectory MLRISC/cm.
    They are moved because there are a lot of them and they clutter up the
    root dir.
+
7.  More detailed documentation to come...
+
    NOTE: To rebuild from 110.30 (ftp distribution), you'll have to do
    a makeml -rebuild first.  This is because of other other
    changes that Matthias has made (see below).
+
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/11/30]::
+
Some manual updates and some file reorganizations in CM.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/11/24]::
+
Drastically improved link traversal code for the case that the dynamic
value was already loaded at bootstrap time.  As a result, CM and CMB
now both load blazingly fast -- even on a very slow machine.  Also,
memory consumption has been further reduced by this.
+
Warning: The format of the PIDMAP file has changed.  THerefore, to
bootstrap you have to do this:
+
1. Run CMB.make
2. Make a symbolic link for the boot directory:
     ln -s sml.boot.ARCH-OS xxx
3. "Rebuild" the boot directory:
     ./makeml -boot xxx -rebuild sml ; rm xxx
4. Boot normally:
      ./makeml

+
Continued hacking on autoloading problem -- with success this time.
Also changed tool-plugin mechanism.  See new CM manual.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/11/19]::
+
Some hacking to make autoloading faster.  Success for CMB, no success
so far for CM.  There is a reduced structure CM' that autoloads faster.
(This is a temporary, non-documented hack to be eliminated again when
the general problem is solved.)
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/11/17]::
+
1. Eliminated comp-lib.cm
2. Made pickle-lib.cm
3. Eliminated all uses of intset.sml (from comp-lib.cm)
4. Replaced all uses of intmap.{sig,sml} (from comp-lib.cm) with
   equivalent constructs from smlnj-lib.cm (INtHashTable).
5. Point 4. also goes for those uses of intmap.* in MLRISC.
   Duplicated intmap modules thrown out.
6. Hunted down all duplicated SCC code and replaced it with
   equivalent stuff (GraphSCCFn from smlnj-lib.cm).
7. Rewrote Feedback module.
8. Moved sortedlist.sml into viscomp-lib.cm.  Eventually it
   should be thrown out and equivalent modules from smlnj-lib.cm
   should be used (IntRedBlackSet, IntListSet, ...).
+
Confirmed that compiler compiles to fixpoint.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/11/10]::
+
A new x86 floating point code generator has been added.
By default this is turned off.  To turn this on, do:
+
    CM.autoload "$smlnj/compiler.cm";
    Compiler.Control.MLRISC.getFlag "x86-fast-fp" := true;
+
Changes:
+
1.  Changed FTAN to FPTAN so that the assembly output is correct.
2.  Changed the extension callback for FTANGENT to generate:
+
          fptan
          fstp  %st(0)
    instead of
          fptan
          fstpl ftempmem
+
3.  Numerous assembly fixes for x86.
+
4.  Cleaned up the machine code output module x86/x86MC.sml and added
    support for a whole bunch of instructions and addressing modes:
+
      fadd/fsub/fsubr/fmul/fdiv/fdivr  %st, %st(n)
      faddp/fsubp/fsubrp/fmulp/fdivp/fdivrp  %st, %st(n)
      fadd/fsub/fsubr/fmul/fdiv/fdivr  %st(n), %st
      fiadd/fisub/fisubr/fimul/fidiv/fidivr mem
      fxch %st(n)
      fld %st(n)
      fst %st(n)
      fst mem
      fstp %st(n)
      fucom %st(n)
      fucomp %st(n)
+
    All these are now generated when the fast fp mode is turned on.
+
5.  Removed the dedicated registers %st(0), ..., %st(7) from X86CpsRegs
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/11/09]::
+
Eliminated some code duplication:
+
1. Added "where" clause to GraphSCCFn in SML/NJ Library.
   (Otherwise the functor is useless.)
2. Used GraphSCCFn where SCCUtilFun was used previously.
3. Got rid of SCCUtilFun (in comp-lib.cm).

!!!! WARNING !!!!
You must recompile the runtime system!
!!!! WARNING !!!!
+
This is basically another round of script-enhancements:
+
1. sml, *ml-build*, and *ml-makedepend* accept options -D and -U to define
   and undefine CM preprocessor symbols.
+
2. *ml-build* avoids generating a new heap image if it finds that the
   existing one is still ok.  (The condition is that no ML file had to
   be recompiled and all ML files are found to be older that the heap
   file.)
+
   To make this work smoothly, I also hacked the runtime system as
   well as SMLofNJ.SysInfo to get access to the heap image suffix
   (.sparc-solaris, ...) that is currently being used.
+
   Moreover, the signature of CM.mk_standalone has changed.  See the
   CM manual.
+
3. *ml-makedepend* accepts additional options -n, -a, and -o.  (See the
   CM manual for details.)
+
4. More CM manual updates:
    - all of the above has been documented.
    - there is now a section describing the (CM-related) command line
      arguments that are accepted by the "sml" command
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/07/25]::
+
Added a script called *ml-makedepend*.  This can be used in makefiles
for Unix' make in a way very similar to the "makedepend" command for
C.
+
The script internally uses function CM.sources.
+
Synopsis:
+
    *ml-makedepend* [-f makefile] cmfile targetname
+
The default for the makefile is "makefile" (or "Makefile" should
"makefile" not exist).
+
*ml-makedepend* adds a cmfile/targetname-specific section to this
makefile (after removing the previous version of this section).  The
section contains a single dependency specification with targetname on
the LHS (targetname is an arbitrary name), and a list of files derived
from the cmfile on the RHS.  Some of the files on the RHS are
ARCH/OPSYS-specific.  Therefore, *ml-makedepend* inserts references to
"make" variables $(ARCH) and $(OPSYS) in place of the corresponding
path names.  The makefile writer is responsible for making sure that
these variables have correct at the time "make" is invoked.

[2000/07/04]::
+
1. Improvements to CM manual.
2. SMLofNJ.Internals.BTrace.trigger reinstated as an alternative way
   of getting a back-trace.  The function, when called, raises an
   internal exception which explicitly carries the full back-trace history,
   so it is unaffected by any intervening handle-raise pairs ("trivial"
   or not).  The interactive loop will print that history once it arrives
   at top level.
   Short of having all exceptions implicitly carry the full history, the
   recommended way of using this facility is:
     - compile your program with instrumentation "on"
     - run it, when it raises an exception, look at the history
     - if the history is "cut off" because of some handler, go and modify
       your program so that it explicitly calls BTrace.trigger
     - recompile (still instrumented), and rerun; look at the full history

owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/06/29]::
+
Changes:
+
1. Class "mlyacc" now takes separate arguments to pass options to
   generated .sml- and .sig-files independently.
2. Corresponding CM manual updates.
3. BTrace module now also reports call sites.  (However, for loop clusters
   it only shows from where the cluster was entered.)  There are associated
   modifications to core.sml, internals.{sig,sml}, btrace.sml, and btimp.sml.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/06/27]::
+
Changes:
+
 1. Implemented "subdir" and "witness" options for noweb tool.
    This caused some slight internal changes in CM's tool implementation.
 2. Fixed bug in "tool plugin" mechanism.  This is essentially cleaning
    some remaining issues from earlier path anchor changes.
 3. Updated CM manual accordingly.
+
 4. Changed implementation of back-tracing so that I now consider it
    ready for prime-time.
+
    In particular, you don't have to explicitly trigger the back-trace
    anymore.  Instead, if you are running BTrace-instrumented code and
    there is an uncaught exception (regardless of whether or not it was
    raised in instrumented code), the top-level evalloop will print
    the back-trace.
+
    Features:
+
      - Instrumented and uninstrumented code work together seemlessly.
        (Of course, uninstrumented code is never mentioned in actual
         back-traces.)
+
      - Asymptotic time- and space-complexity of instrumented code is
        equal to that of uninstrumented code.  (This means that
        tail-recursion is preserved by the instrumentation phase.)
+
      - Modules whose code has been instrumented in different sessions
        work together without problem.
+
      - There is no penalty whatsoever on uninstrumented code.
+
      - There is no penalty on "raise" expressions, even in
        instrumented code.
+
    A potential bug (or perhaps it is a feature, too):
+
      A back-trace reaches no further than the outermost instrumented
      non-trivial "raise".  Here, a "trivial" raise is one that is the
      sole RHS of a "handle" rule.  Thus, back-traces reach trough
+
           <exp> handle e => raise e
+
      and even
+
           <exp> handle Foo => raise Bar
+
      and, of course, through
+
           <exp> handle Foo => ...
+
     if the exception was not Foo.
+
     Back-traces always reach right through any un-instrumented code
     including any of its "handle" expressions, trivial or not.
+
   To try this out, do the following:
+
     - Erase all existing binfiles for your program.
       (You may keep binfiles for those modules where you think you
        definitely don't need back-tracing.)
     - Turn on back-trace instrumentation:
          SMLofNJ.Internals.BTrace.mode (SOME true);
     - Recompile your program.  (I.e., run "CM.make" or "use".)
     - You may now turn instrumentation off again (if you want):
          SMLofNJ.Internals.BTrace.mode (SOME false);
     - Run your program as usual.  If it raises an exception that
       reaches the interactive toplevel, then a back-trace will
       automatically be printed.  After that, the toplevel loop
       will print the exception history as usual.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/06/23]::
+
This updates adds a backtrace facility to aid programmers in debugging
their programs.  This involves the following changes:
+
1. Module system/smlnj/init/core.sml (structure _Core) now has hooks for
   keeping track of the current call stack.  When programs are compiled
   in a special mode, the compiler will insert calls to these hooks
   into the user program.
   "Hook" means that it is possible for different implementations of
   back-tracing to register themselves (at different times).
+
2. compiler/MiscUtil/profile/btrace.sml implements the annotation phase
   as an Absyn.dec->Absyn.dec rewrite.  Normally this phase is turned off.
   It can be turned on using this call:
     SMLofNJ.Internals.BTrace.mode (SOME true);
   Turning it off again:
     SMLofNJ.Internals.BTrace.mode (SOME false);
   Querying the current status:
     SMLofNJ.Internals.BTrace.mode NONE;
   Annotated programs are about twice as big as normal ones, and they
   run a factor of 2 to 4 slower with a dummy back-trace plugin (one
   where all hooks do nothing).  The slowdown with a plugin that is
   actually useful (such as the one supplied by default) is even greater,
   but in the case of the default plugin it is still only an constant
   factor (amortized).
+
3. system/Basis/Implementation/NJ/internals.{sig,sml} have been augmented
   with a sub-structure BTrace for controlling back-tracing.  In particular,
   the above-mentioned function "mode" controls whether the annotation
   phase is invoked by the compiler.  Another important function is
   "trigger": when called it aborts the current execution and causes
   the top-level loop to print a full back-trace.
+
4. compiler/MiscUtil/profile/btimp.sml is the current default plugin
   for back-tracing.  It keeps track of the dynamic call stack and in
   addition to that it keeps a partial history at each "level" of that
   stack.  For example, if a tail-calls b, b tail-calls c, and c tail-calls
   d and b (at separate times, dynamically), then the report will show:
+
.................
   GOTO   d
         /c
   GOTO  \b
   CALL   a
.................
+
   This shows that there was an initial non-tail call of a, then a
   tail-call to b or c, looping behavior in a cluster of functions that
   consist of b and c, and then a goto from that cluster (_i.e._, either from
   b or from c) to d.
+
   Note that (depending on the user program) the amount of information
   that the back-trace module has to keep track of at each level is bounded
   by a constant.  Thus, the whole implementation has the same asymptotical
   complexity as the original program (both in space and in time).
+
5. compiler/TopLevel/interact/evalloop.sml has been modified to
   handle the special exception SMLofNJ.Internals.BTrace.BTrace
   which is raised by the "trigger" function mentioned above.
+
Notes on usage:
+
- Annotated code works well together with unannotated code:
Unannotated calls simply do not show up at all in the backtrace.
+
- It is not a good idea to let modules that were annotated during
different sessions run at the same time.  This is because the compiler
chooses small integers to identify individual functions, and there
will be clashes if different modules were compiled in separate sessions.
(Nothing will crash, and you will even be told about the clashes, but
back-trace information will in general not be useful.)
+
- Back-tracing can be confused by callcc and capture.
+
- The only way of getting a back-trace right now is to explicitly
invoke the "trigger" function from your user program.  Eventually, we
should make every exception carry back-trace information (if
available).  But since this creates more overhead at "raise"-time
(similar to the current exnHistory overhead), I have not yet
implemented this.  (The implementation will be rather easy.)  With
exceptions carrying back-trace information, this facility will be even
more useful because users don't need to modify their programs...
+
- While it is possible to compile the compiler with back-trace
annotations turned on (I did it to get some confidence in
correctness), you must make absolutely sure that core.sml and
btimp.sml are compiled WITHOUT annotation!  (core.sml cannot actually
be compiled with annotation because there is no core access yet, but
if you compile btimp.sml with annotation, then the system will go into
an infinite recursion and crash.)
Since CM currently does not know about BTrace, the only way to turn
annotations on and off for different modules of the compiler is to
interrupt CMB.make, change the settings, and re-invoke it.  Of course,
this is awkward and clumsy.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/06/18]::
+
I updates the previous HISTORY entry where I forgot to mention that
implicit anchors are no longer with us.
+
The current update also gets rid of the (now useless) controller
CM.Control.implicit_anchors.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/06/16]::
+
This patch implements the long anticipated (just kidding :) "anchor
environment" mechanism.  In the course of doing this, I also
re-implemented CM's internal "SrcPath" module from scratch.  The new
one should be more robust in certain boundary cases.  In any case, it
is a lot cleaner than its predecessor (IMHO).
+
This time, although there is yet another boot file format change, I
kept the unpickler backward-compatible.  As a result, no new bootfiles
are necessary and bootstrapping is straightforward.  (You cannot read
new bootfiles into an old system, but the other way around is no
problem.)
+
Visible changes:
+
--
1. Implicit path anchors (without the leading $-symbol) are no
   longer recognized at all. This means that such path names are not
   illegal either.  For example, the name basis.cm simply refers to a
   local file called "basis.cm" (i.e, the name is an ordinary path
   relative to .cm-files directory).  Or, to put it differently, only
   names that start with $ are anchored paths.
+
2. The $<singlearc> abbreviation for $/<singlearc> has finally vanished.
+
   John (Reppy) had critizised this as soon as I originally proposed and
   implemented it, but at that time I did not really deeply believe
   him. :) Now I came full-circle because I need the $<singlearc> syntax
   in another place where it cannot be seen as an abbreviation for
   $/<singlearc>.  To avoid the confusion, $<singlearc> now means what it
   seems to mean (_i.e._, it "expands" into the corresponding anchor
   value).
+
   However, when paths are used as members in CM description files, it
   continues to be true that there must be at least another arc after the
   anchor.  This is now enforced separately during semantic analysis
   (_i.e._, from a lexical/syntactical point of view, the notation is ok.)
+
3. The "cm" class now accepts an option "bind".  The option's value
   is a sub-option list of precisely two items -- one labeled "anchor"
   and the other one labeled "value".  As you might expect, "anchor" is
   used to specify an anchor name to be bound, and "value" specifies what
   the anchor is being bound to.
+
   The value must be a directory name and can be given in either standard
   syntax (including the possibility that it is itself an anchored path)
   or native syntax.
+
   Examples:
+
      foo.cm (bind:(anchor:bar value:$mystuff/bar))
      lib.cm (bind:(anchor:a value:"H:\\x\\y\\z"))  (* only works under windows *)
+
   and so on.
+
   The meaning of this is that the .cm-file will be processed with an
   augmented anchor environment where the given anchor(s) is/are bound to
   the given values(s).
+
   The rationale for having this feature is this: Suppose you are trying
   to use two different (already stable) libraries a.cm and b.cm (that
   you perhaps didn't write yourself).  Further, suppose each of these
   two libraries internally uses its own auxiliary library $aux/lib.cm.
   Normally you would now have a problem because the anchor "lib" can not
   be bound to more than one value globally.  Therefore, the project that
   uses both a.cm and b.cm must locally redirect the anchor to some other
   place:
+
      a.cm (bind:(anchor:lib value:/usr/lib/smlnj/a-stuff))
      b.cm (bind:(anchor:lib value:/usr/lib/smlnj/b-stuff))
+
   This hard-wires $lib/aux.cm to /usr/lib/smlnj/a-stuff/aux.cm or
   /usr/lib/smlnj/b-stuff/aux.cm, respectively.
+
   Hard-wiring path names is a bit inflexible (and CM will verbosely warn
   you when you do so at the time of CM.stabilize).  Therefore, you can
   also use an anchored path as the value:
+
     a.cm (bind:(anchor:lib value:$a-lib))
     b.cm (bind:(anchor:lib value:$b-lib))
+
   Now you can globally configure (using the usual CM.Anchor.anchor or
   pathconfig machinery) bindings for "a-lib" and "b-lib".  Since "lib"
   itself is always locally bound, setting it globally is no longer
   meaningful or necessary (but it does not hurt either).  In fact, "lib"
   can still be used as a global anchor for separate purposes.  As a
   matter of fact, one can locally define "lib" in terms of a global
   "lib":
+
     a.cm (bind:(anchor:lib value:$lib/a))
     b.cm (bind:(anchor:lib value:$lib/b))
+
4: The encoding of path names has changed.  This affects the way
   path names are shown in CM's progress report and also the internal
   protocol encoding used for parallel make.
+
   The encoding now uses one or more ':'-separated segments.  Each
   segments corresponds to a file that has been specified relative to the
   file given by its preceding segment.  The first segment is either
   relative to the CWD, absolute, or anchored.  Each segment itself is
   basically a Unix pathname; all segments but the first are relative.
+
   Example:
+
      $foo/bar/baz.cm:a/b/c.sml
+
   This path denotes the file bar/a/b/c.sml relative to the directory
   denoted by anchor "foo".  Notice that the encoding also includes
   baz.cm which is the .cm-file that listed a/b/c.sml.  As usual, such
   paths are resolved relative to the .cm-files directory, so baz.cm must
   be ignored to get the "real" pathname.
+
   To make this fact more obvious, CM puts the names of such "virtual
   arcs" into parentheses when they appear in progress reports. (No
   parentheses will appear in the internal protocol encoding.)  Thus,
   what you really see is:
+
     $foo/bar/(baz.cm):a/b/c.sml
+
   I find this notation to be much more informative than before.
+
   Another new feature of the encoding is that special characters
   including parentheses, colons, (back)slashes, and white space are
   written as \ddd (where ddd is the decimal encoding of the character).

[2000/06/07]::

1. This update changes the default setting for
CM.Control.implicit_anchors from true to false.  This means that
implicit anchors are no longer permitted by default.  I also tried to
make sure that nothing else still relies on implicit anchors.

have the notion of implicit anchors anymore.)
+
2. More CM manual updates.

3. I managed to track down and fix the pickling bug I mentioned last
time.  Because of the previously existing workaround, this entails no
immediate practical changes.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//====================================================================
== Version 110.28.1; 2000/06/06


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/06/06]::
+
* The main purpose of this update is to make library pickles lazier in
order to reduce the initial space penalty for autoloading a library.
As a result, it is now possible to have $smlnj/compiler.cm
pre-registered.  This should take care of the many complaints or
inquiries about missing structure Compiler.  This required changes to
CM's internal data structures and small tweaks to some algorithms.
+
As a neat additional effect, it is no longer necessary (for the sake
of lean heap image files) to distinguish between a "minimal" CM and a
"full" CM.  Now, there is only one CM (_i.e._, the "full" version:
$smlnj/cm.cm aka $smlnj/cm/full.cm), and it is always available at the
interactive top level. ($smlnj/cm/minimal.cm is gone.)
+
To make the life of compiler-hackers easier, "makeml" now also
pre-registers $smlnj/cmb.cm (aka $smlnj/cmb/current.cm).  In other
words, after you bootstrap a new sml for the first time, you will not
have to autoload $smlnj/cmb.cm again afterwards.  (The first time
around you will still have to do it, though.)
+
* A second change consists of major updates to the CM manual.  There
are now several appendices with summary information and also a full
specification of the CM description file syntax.
+
* In directory src/system I added the script "allcross".  This script
invokes sml and cross-compiles the compiler for all supported
architectures.  (Useful when providing a new set of boot files.)
+
* There seems to be a latent bug in my "lazy pickles" mechanism.  I
added a small tweak to pickle-util.sml to work around this problem,
but it is not a proper fix yet.  I will investigate further.  (The
effect of the bug was an inflation of library pickle size.)
+
* Version number increased to 110.28.1 (to avoid compatibility problems).

+
  These have no effect on SML/NJ.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/05/15]::
+
1. I added an alternative to "-rebuild" to "makeml".  The difference is
   that prior to calling CMB.make' the CM-variable "LIGHT" will be
   defined.  In effect, the command will not build any cross-compiler
   backends and therefore finish more quickly.
+
   The "fixpt" script also takes a "-light" switch to be able to use
   this new facility while compiling for a fixpoint.
+
2. I replaced all mentions of anchored paths in group owner specifications
   with simple relative paths (usually starting with "..").
   The rationale is that a library's internal workings should not be
   compromised by the lack of some anchor.  (An anchor is necessary
   for someone who wants to refer to the library by an anchored path,
   but it should not be necessary to build the same library in the first
   place.)
+
3. I changed the way CM's tool mechanism determines the shell command
   string used for things like *ml-yacc* etc. so that it does not break
   when CM.Control.implicit_anchors is turned off.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

[2000/05/12]::
+
!!! NEW BOOT FILES !!!
+
This change is in preparation of fading out support for "implicitly
anchored path names".  I went through all sources and used the
explicit (and relatively new) $-notation.  See system/README and the
CM manual for more info on this.
+
I also modified the anchoring scheme for some things such as "smlnj",
"MLRISC", "cm", etc. to take advantage of the fact that explicit
anchors are more expressive: anchor name and first arc do not have to
coincide.  This entails the following user-visible change:
+
You have to write $smlnj/foo/bar instead of smlnj/foo/bar.  In
particular, when you fire up sml with a command-line argument, say,
_e.g._:
+
   sml '$smlnj/cmb.cm'
+
At the ML toplevel prompt:
+
   CM.autoload "$smlnj/cmb.cm";
+
There is also a new controller in CM.Control that can be used to turn
off all remaining support for implicit anchors by saying:
+
    CM.autoload "$smlnj/
    #set CM.Control.implicit_anchors false;
+
This causes CM to reject implicitly anchored paths.  This is (for the
time being) less permissive than the "final" version where there will
be no more such implicit anchors and relative paths will be just that:
relative.
+
The next step (version after next version?) will be to make the
default for CM.Control.implicit_anchors false.  After the dust has
settled, I can then produce the "final" version of this...
+
Note: Since bootstrapping is a bit tricky, I provided new boot files.
+

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/05/11]::

+

[2000/04/30]::
+
1. CM version numbering added.  This is an implementation of Lal's
   proposal for adding version numbers and version checking to .cm
   files.  Lal said that his proposal was just that -- a proposal.
   For the time being I went ahead and implemented it so that people
   can comment on it.  Everything is completely backward-compatible
   (except for the stable library format, _i.e._, new bootfiles!).
+
   As usual, see the CM manual for details.
+
2. An alternative syntax for anchored paths has been implemented.
   Dave has recently voiced the same concerns that I had when I did
   this, so there should be some support.  My take is that eventually
   I will let support for the current syntax (where anchors are
   "implicit") fade out in favor of the new, explicit syntax.
   In order to be backward-compatible, both old and new syntax are
   currently supported.
+
   Again, see the CM manual for details.
+
3. Parallel make is trying to be slightly smarter:  When the master
   process finds a "bottleneck", _i.e._, when there is only one
   compilation unit that can be compiled and everybody else is
   waiting on it, then it will simply compile it directly instead
   of clumsily telling one of the slaves to do it.
+
4. Support for "unsharing" added.  This is necessary in order to be
   able to have two different versions of the same library running
   at the same time (_e.g._, for trying out a new MLRISC while still
   having the old MLRISC linked into the current compiler, etc.)
   See the CM manual.
+
5. Simple "makedepend" functionality added for generating Makefile
   dependency information.  (This is rather crude at the moment.
   Expect some changes here in the future.)
+
6. ".fun" added as a recognized suffix for ML files. Also documented
   explicitly in the manual that the fallback behavior (unknown suffix
   -> ML file) is not an official feature!
+
7. Small changes to the pickler for stable libraries.
+
8. Several internal changes to CM (for cleanup/improvement).
+
+

[2000/04/28]::
+
1. I changed config/install.sh to remove duplicate entries from the
   lib/pathconfig file at the end.  Moreover, the final version of
   lib/pathconfig is sorted alphabetically.  The same (sorting) is done
   in src/system/installml.
+
2. The config/install.sh script now consistently uses relative
   pathnames in lib/pathconfig whenever the anchor is in the lib
   directory.  (So far this was true for the libraries that come
   pre-compiled and bundled as part of the bootfiles but not for
   libraries that are compiled by the script itself.)

[2000/04/20]::
+
  This update synchronizes my repository with Yale's.  Most of these
changes, however, do not affect SML/NJ at all (the RA is an exception).
+
1. Register Allocator
+
   a. An improvement in the interference graph construction:
      Given a copy
+
            s <- t
+
      no interference edge between s and t is added for this definition of s.
+
   b. I've added two new spill heuristic modules that Fermin and I developed
      (in the new library RA.cm). These are unused in SML/NJ but maybe
      useful for others (Moby?)
+
2. X86
+
   a. Various fixes in the backend provided by Fermin [C--] and Lal.
+
3. Alpha
+
   a. Added the BSR instruction and code generation that goes with it [C--]
   b. Other fixes too numerous to recount provided by Fermin [C--]
+
4. Regmaps
+
   a. The regmaps are not initialized with the identity physical bindings
      at creation time.  This is unneeded.
+
5. MLRISC Optimizations
+
   a. The DJ-Graph module can now compute the iterated dominance frontiers
      intersects with liveness incrementally in linear time! Woohoo!
      This is now used in my new SSA construction algorithm.
+
   b. THe branch reorganization module is now smarter about linear chains of
      basic blocks.

This update just merges three minor cosmetic updates to CM's sources
to get ready for the 110.27 code freeze on Friday.  No functionality
has changed.
+
owner:www.tti-c.org/~blume[Matthias Blume]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/04/04]::
+
1.  Fixed a problem in X86 assembly.
+
    Things like
+
       jmp %eax
       jmp (%eax)
+
    should be output as
+
       jmp *%eax
       jmp *(%eax)
+
2.  Assembly output
+
      Added a new flag
+
          "asm-indent-copies" (default to false)
+
      When this flag is on, parallel copies will be indented an extra level.
+
owner:smlnj.org[Allen Leung]

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/04/04]::
+
    All of these fixes are related to C--, Moby, and my own optimization
    stuff; so they shouldn't affect SML/NJ.
+
1.  X86
+
    Various fixes related floating point, and extensions.
+
2.  Alpha
+
    Some extra patterns related to loads with signed/zero extension
    provided by Fermin.
+
3.  Assembly
+
    When generating assembly, resolve the value of client defined constants,
    instead of generating symbolic values.  This is controlled by the
    new flag "asm-resolve-constants", which is default to true.
+
4.  Machine Descriptions
+
    a. The precedence parser was slightly broken when parsing infixr symbols.
    b. The type generalizing code had the bound variables reversed, resulting
       in a problem during arity raising.
    c. Various fixes in machine descriptions.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/04/03]::
+
I eliminated coreEnv from compInfo.  Access to the "Core" structure is
now done via the ordinary static environment that is context to each
compilation unit.
+
To this end, I arranged that instead of "structure Core" as "structure
_Core" is bound in the pervasive environment.  Core access is done via
_Core (which can never be accidentally rebound because _Core is not a
legal surface-syntax symbol).
+
The current solution is much cleaner because the core environment is
now simply part of the pervasive environment which is part of every
compilation unit's context anyway.  In particular, this eliminates all
special-case handling that was necessary until now in order to deal
with dynamic and symbolic parts of the core environment.
+
Remaining hackery (to bind the "magic" symbol _Core) is localized in the
compilation manager's bootstrap compiler (actually: in the "init group"
handling).  See the comments in src/system/smlnj/init/init.cmi for
more details.
+
I also tried to track down all mentions of "Core" (as string argument
to Symbol.strSymbol) in the compiler and replaced them with a
reference to the new CoreSym.coreSym.  Seems cleaner since the actual
name appears in one place only.
+
Binfile and bootfile format have not changed, but the switchover from
the old "init.cmi" to the new one is a bit tricky, so I supplied new
bootfiles anyway.
+

[2000/04/02]::

   1. Renamed the constructor CALL in MLTREE by popular demand.

This update contains a rewritten (and hopefully more correct) module
for extracting aliasing information from CPS.
+
   To turn on this feature:
+
        Compiler.Control.CG.memDisambiguate := true
+
   To pretty print the region information with assembly
+
       Compiler.Control.MLRISC.getFlag "asm-show-region" := true;
+
   To control how many levels of aliasing information are printed, use:

   The default of n is 3.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/03/31]::
+
This update contains:
+
1. A small change to CM's handling of stable libraries:
   CM now maintains one "global" modmap that is used for all stable
   libraries.  The use of such a global modmap maximizes sharing and
   minimizes the need for re-traversing parts of environments during
   modmap construction.  (However, this has minor impact since modmap
   construction seems to account for just one percent or less of total
   compile time.)
+
2. I added a "genmap" phase to the statistics.  This is where I got the
   "one percent" number (see above).
+
3. CM's new tool parameter mechanism just became _even_ better. :)
   - The parser understands named parameters and recursive options.
   - The "make" and "shell" tools use these new features.
     (This makes it a lot easier to cascade these tools.)
   - There is a small syntax change: named parameters use a
+
       <name> : ( <option> ... )            or
       <name> : <string>
+
     syntax.  Previously, named parameters were implemented in an
     ad-hoc fashion by each tool individually (by parsing strings)
     and had the form
+
       <name>=<string>
+
   See the CM manual for a full description of these issues.

== Version 110.26.2; 2000/03/30


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2000/03/30]::
+
!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!
!!  New binfiles  !!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
+
This update contains:
+
1. Moderate changes to CM:
+
   - Changes to CM's tools mechanism.  In particular, it is now possible
   to have tools that accept additional "command line" parameters
   (specified in the .cm file at each instance where the tool's class is
   used).
+
   This was done to accommodate the new "make" and "shell" tools which
   facilitate fairly seamless hookup to portions of code managed using
   Makefiles or Shell scripts.
+
   There are no classes "shared" or "private" anymore.  Instead, the
   sharing annotation is now a parameter to the "sml" class.
+
   There is a bit of generic machinery for implementing one's own
   tools that accept command-line parameters.  However, I am not yet fully
   satisfied with that part, so expect changes here in the future.
+
   All existing tools are described in the CM manual.
+
   - Slightly better error handling.  (CM now suppresses many followup
   error messages that tended to be more annoying than helpful.)
+
2. Major changes to the compiler's static environment data structures.
+
   - no CMStaticEnv anymore.
        - no CMEnv, no "BareEnvironment" (actually, _only_ BareEnvironment,
          but it is called Environment), no conversions between different
          kinds of static environments
+
   - There is still a notion of a "modmap", but such modmaps are generated
     on demand at the time when they are needed.  This sounds slow, but I
     sped up the code that generates modmaps enough for this not to lead to
     a slowdown of the compiler (at least I didn't detect any).
+
   - To facilitate rapid modmap generation, static environments now
     contain an (optional) "modtree" structure.  Modtree annotations are
     constructed by the unpickler during unpickling.  (This means that
     the elaborator does not have to worry about modtrees at all.)
     Modtrees have the advantage that they are compositional in the same
     way as the environment data structure itself is compositional.
     As a result, modtrees never hang on to parts of an environment that
     has already been rendered "stale" by filtering or rebinding.
+
   - I went through many, many trials and errors before arriving at the
     current solution.  (The initial idea of "linkpaths" did not work.)
     But the result of all this is that I have touched a lot of files that
     depend on the "modules" and "types" data structures (most of the
     elaborator). There were a lot of changes during my "linkpath" trials
     that could have been reverted to their original state but weren't.
     Please, don't be too harsh on me for messing with this code a bit more
     than what was strictly necessary...  (I _did_ resist the temptation
     of doing any "global reformatting" to avoid an untimely death at
     Dave's hands. :)
+
   - One positive aspect of the previous point:  At least I made sure that
     all files that I touched now compile without warnings (other than
     "polyEqual").
+
   - compiler now tends to run "leaner" (_i.e._, ties up less memory in
     redundant modmaps)

[2000/03/29]::
+
Boot files (optional): ftp://react-ilp.cs.nyu.edu/leunga/110.26.1-sml.boot.x86-unix-20000330.tar.gz
+
   This update contains *MAJOR* changes to the way code is generated from CPS
in the module mlriscGen, and in various backend modules.
+
*CHANGES*
+
1. MLRiscGen: forward propagation fix.
+
   There was a bug in forward propagation introduced at about the same time
   as the MLRISC x86 backend, which prohibits coalescing to be
   performed effectively in loops.
+
   Effect: speed up of loops in RISC architectures.
           By itself, this actually slowed down certain benchmarks on the x86.
+
2. MLRiscGen:  forward propagating addresses from consing.
+
   I've changed the way consing code is generated.  Basically I separated
   out the initialization part:
+
        store tag,   offset(allocptr)
        store elem1, offset+4(allocptr)
        store elem2, offset+8(allocptr)
        ...
        store elemn, offset+4n(allocptr)
+
   and the address computation part:
+
        celladdr <- offset+4+alloctpr
+
   and move the address computation part
+
   Effect:  register pressure is generally lower as a result.  This
            makes compilation of certain expressions much faster, such as
            long lists with non-trivial elements.
+
             [(0,0), (0,0), .... (0,0)]
+
3. MLRiscGen: base pointer elimination.
+
    As part of the linkage mechanism, we generate the sequence:
+
     L:  ...  <- start of the code fragment
+
     L1:
         base pointer <- linkreg - L1 + L
+
     The base pointer was then used for computing relocatable addresses
   in the code fragment.  Frequently (such as in lots of continuations)
   this is not needed.  We now eliminate this sequence whenever possible.
+
     For compile time efficiency, I'm using a very stupid local heuristic.
   But in general, this should be done as a control flow analysis.
+
   Effect:  Smaller code size.  Speed up of most programs.
+
4. Hppa back end
+
     Long jumps in span dependence resolution used to depend on the existence
  of the base pointer.
+
     A jump to a long label L was expanded into the following sequence:
+
      LDIL %hi(L-8192), %r29
      LDO  %lo(L-8192)(%r29), %r29
      ADD  %r29, baseptr, %r29
      BV,n %r0(%r29)
+
     In the presence of change (3) above, this will not work.  I've changed
   it so that the following sequence of instructions are generated, which
   doesn't mention the base pointer at all:
+
         BL,n  L', %r29           /* branch and link, L' + 4 -> %r29 */
    L':  ADDIL L-(L'+4), %r29     /* Compute address of L */
         BV,n  %r0(%r29)          /* Jump */
+
5. Alpha back end
+
      New alpha instructions LDB/LDW have been added, as per Fermin's
   suggestions.   This is unrelated to all other changes.
+
6. X86 back end
+
     I've changed andl to testl in the floating point test sequence
     whenever appropriate.  The Intel optimization guide states that
     testl is preferable to andl.
+
7. RA (x86 only)
+
     I've improved the spill propagation algorithm, using an approximation
   of maximal weighted independent sets.   This seems to be necessary to
   alleviate the negative effect in light of the slow down in (1).
+
     I'll write down the algorithm one of these days.
+
8. MLRiscGen: frequencies
+
     I've added an annotation that states that all call gc blocks have zero
   execution frequencies.  This improves register allocation on the x86.
+
*BENCHMARKS*
+
   I've only perform the comparison on 110.25.
+
   The platforms are:
+
    HPPA  A four processor HP machine (E9000) with 5G of memory.
    X86   A 300Hhz Pentium II with 128M of memory, and
    SPARC An Ultra sparc 2 with 512M of memory.
+
   I used the following parameters for the SML benchmarks:
+
             @SMLalloc
     HPPA    256k
     SPARC   512k
     X86     256k
+
*COMPILATION TIME*
+
   Here are the numbers comparing the compilation times of the compilers.
   I've only compared 110.25 compiling the new sources versus
   a fixpoint version of the new compiler compiling the same.
+
                 110.25                                  New
           Total  Time in RA  Spill+Reload   Total  Time In RA Spill+Reload
     HPPA   627s    116s        2684+3584     599s    95s       1003+1879
     SPARC  892s    173s        2891+3870     708s    116s      1004+1880
     X86    999s    315s       94006+130691   987s    296s    108877+141957
+
               110.25         New
            Code Size      Code Size
     HPPA   8596736         8561421
     SPARC  8974299         8785143
     X86    9029180         8716783
+
   So in summary, things are at least as good as before.   Dramatic
   reduction in compilation is obtained on the Sparc; I can't explain it,
   but it is reproducible.  Perhaps someone should try to reproduce this
   on their own machines.
+
*SML BENCHMARKS*
+
    On the average, all benchmarks perform at least as well as before.

1. Tools.registerStdShellCmdTool (from smlnj/cm/tool.cm) takes an
additional argument called "template" which is an optional string that
specifies the layout of the tool command line.  See the CM manual for
explanation.
+
2. A special-purpose tool can be "registered" by simply dropping the
corresponding <...>-tool.cm (and/or <...>-ext.cm) into the same
directory where the .cm file lives that uses this tool.  (The
behavior/misfeature until now was to look for the tool description
files in the current working directory.)  As before, tool description
files could also be anchored -- in which case they can live anywhere
they like.  Following the recent e-mail discussion, this change should
make it easier to have special-purpose tools that are shipped together
with the sources of the program that uses them.

I added a re-written version of Dave's fixpt script to src/system.
Changes relative to the original version:
  - sh-ified (not everybody has ksh)
  - automatically figures out which architecture it runs on
  - uses ./makeml a bit more cleverly
  - never invokes ./installml (and, thus, does not clobber your
    good and working installation of sml in case something goes wrong)
  - accepts max iteration count using option "-iter <n>"
  - accepts a "base" name using option "-base <base>"
+
It does not build any extraneous heap images but directly rebuilds
bin- and boot-hierarchies using makeml's "-rebuild" switch. Finally,
it can incorporate existing bin- and boot- hierarchies.  For example,
suppose the base is set to "sml" (which is the default).  Then it
successively builds
+
        sml.bin.<arch>-unix and sml.boot.<arch>-unix
then    sml1.bin.<arch>-unix and sml1.boot.<arch>-unix
then    sml2.bin.<arch>-unix and sml2.boot.<arch>-unix
...
then    sml<n>.bin.<arch>-unix and sml<n>.boot.<arch>-unix
+
and so on.  If any of these already exist, it will just use what's
there.  In particular, many people will have the initial set of bin
and boot files around, so this saves time for at least one full
rebuild.  Having sets of the form <base><k>.{bin,boot}.<arch>-unix for
<k>=1,2,... is normally not a good idea when invoking fixpt.  However,
they might be the result of an earlier partial run of fixpt (which
perhaps got accidentally killed).  In this case, fixpt will quickly
move through what exists before continuing where it left off earlier,
and, thus, saves a lot of time.

More assembly output problems involving the indexed addressing mode
on the x86 have been found and corrected. Thanks to Fermin Reig for the
fix.
+
The interface and implementation of the register allocator have been changed
slightly to accommodate the possibility to skip the register allocation
phases completely and go directly to memory allocation.  This is needed
for C-- use.

* Complete re-organization of library names.  Many libraries have been
consolidated so that they share the same path anchor.  For example,
all MLRISC-related libraries are anchored at MLRISC, most libraries that
are SML/NJ-specific are under "smlnj".  Notice that names like
host-cmb.cm or host-compiler.cm no longer exist.  See system/README
for a complete description of the new naming scheme.  Quick reference:
+
   host-cmb.cm        -> smlnj/cmb.cm
   host-compiler.cm   -> smlnj/compiler.cm
   full-cm.cm         -> smlnj/cm.cm
   <arch>-<os>.cm     -> smlnj/cmb/<arch>-<os>.cm
   <arch>-compiler.cm -> smlnj/compiler/<arch>.cm
+
* Bug fixes in CM.
    - exceptions in user code are being passed through (_i.e._, reach top level)
    - more bugs in paranoia mode fixed
    - bug related to checking group owners fixed
+
* New install.sh script that automagically fetches archive files:
The new file config/srcarchiveurl must contain the URL of the
(remote) directory that contains bin files (or other source archives).
If install.sh does not find the archive locally, it tries to get
it from that remote directory.
This should simplify installation further:  For machines that have
access to the internet, just fetch <version>-config.tgz, unpack it,
edit config/targets, and go (run config/install.sh).  The script will
fetch everything else that it might need all by itself.
+
For CVS users, this mechanism is not relevant for source archives, but
it is convenient for getting new sets of binfiles.
+
Archives should be tar files compressed with either gzip, compress, or
bzip2.  The script recognizes .tgz, .tar, tar.gz, tz, .tar.Z, and .tar.bz2.

- size info in BOOTLIST
     * no fixed upper limits for number of bootfiles or length of
       bootfile names in runtime
     * falling back to old behavior if no BOOTLIST size info found
- allocation size heuristics in .run-sml
     * tries to read cache size from /proc/cpuinfo (this is important for
        small-cache Celeron systems!)
- install.sh robustified
- CM manual updates
- paranoid mode
     * no more CMB.deliver() (_i.e._, all done by CMB.make())
     * can re-use existing sml.boot.* files
     * init.cmi now treated as library
     * library stamps for consistency checks
- sml.boot.<arch>-<os>/PIDMAP file
     * This file is read by the CM startup code.  This is used to minimize
       the amount of dynamic state that needs to be stowed away for the
       purpose of sharing between interactive system and user code.
- CM.Anchor.anchor instead of CM.Anchor.{set,cancel}
     * Upon request by Elsa.  Anchors now controlled by get-set-pair
       like most other CM state variables.
- Compiler.CMSA eliminated
     * No longer supported by CM anyway.
- fixed bugs in pickler that kept biting Stefan
     * past refs to past refs (was caused by the possibility that
       ad-hoc sharing is more discriminating than hash-cons sharing)
     * integer overflow on LargeInt.minInt
- ml-{lex,yacc} build scripts now use new mechanism
  for building standalone programs
- fixed several gcc -Wall warnings that were caused by missing header
  files, missing initializations, etc., in runtime (not all warnings
  eliminated, though)
