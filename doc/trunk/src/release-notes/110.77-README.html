<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>
The primary purpose of this release is bug fixes, but it does include some new features
and adds support for Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite).
</p>

<h3>Details:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt class="component">SML/NJ compiler:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    We added the <tt>PackWord</tt>{<tt>16</tt>,<tt>32</tt>}{<tt>Big</tt>,<tt>Little</tt>}
    structures to the <tt>Unsafe</tt> module.
    This change makes SML/NJ's <tt>UNSAFE</tt> signature closer to the MLton version.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt class="component">ml-lpt</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Fixed an inconsistency in the way that ml-antlr and ml-ulex handled the contents of
    a <tt>%defs</tt> declaration.  Ml-ulex made these definitions visible in the <tt>UserDeclarations</tt>
    substructure, whereas ml-antlr hid them.  We have changed the behavior of ml-ulex to match
    that of ml-antlr (<i>i.e.</i>, hide the user definitions).  We chose to hide the user definitions
    in ml-ulex because they are usually not useful outside the lexer, hiding them reduces The
    size of the generated code, and definitions that are needed outside the lexer can be
    defined in an external module.  Note that the previous behavior remains when ml-ulex is
    run in ml-lex compatibility mode.  (This change addresses bug #79).
    </p>
    <p>
    Added the <tt>actionToString'</tt> and <tt>repairToString'</tt> functions
    to the <tt>AntlrRepair</tt> structure.  These functions allow one to
    specialize the printing of tokens based on whether they are
    being added or deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
    Removed the <tt>toksToString</tt> function from the tokens structure that ml-antlr
    generates.  It was originally for use by the <tt>AntlrRepair</tt> structure, but that
    structure does not use it.
    </p>
    <p>
    Fixed a minor bug where a syntax error in the grammar specification could go undetected and
    result in a syntatically incorrect output file.
    </p>
    <p>
    Improvements to the documentation.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt class="component">SML/NJ Library:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Added new library for parsing XML files.  The library does not support validation
    or the full XML syntax.  It is designed to for applications that need to process
    XML-format data files.  To include the library in a project, add the following
    line in your CM file:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="code">
$/xml-lib.cm
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    Reimplementation of the delete/remove operations in the red-black-tree
    versions of sets and maps.  The previous implementation had a bug
    that could result in violations of the data-structure invariants,
    which was leading to unbalanced trees and loss of performance.
    </p>
    <p>
    Fixes and improvements to the S-expression parsing library.  The supported syntax
    is now a proper subset of that found in Lisp-like languages.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt class="component">Build scripts</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Changed how the system handles running on Cygwin.  Previously, the default behavior
    was to run the Win32 version of the runtime.  Now the default behavior is to run
    the Cygwin (<i>i.e.</i>, Unix) version of the runtime.  Setting the shell variable
    <tt>SMLNJ_WINDOWS_RUNTIME</tt> to any non-empty value will cause the Win32 runtime
    to be used.  The script <tt>config/build-windows.sh</tt> has been added to make
    using Cygwin to build the windows version more convenient.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt class="component">Documentation</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    This release includes Unix-style manual pages for the command-line tools.  On Mac OS X
    (x86 only), the installer will copy these to <tt>/usr/local/share/man</tt> (if it exists).
    </p>
  </dd>
</ul>

        Fixed a long-standing bug in <tt>Socket.recvVec</tt>, which prevented the result

      <li class="bug">

<h3>Supported systems:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
We have verified that the system builds and runs on the following systems.
</p>
<div>

  <tr><th>Architecture</th> <th>Operating System</th></td>
  <tr><td>PowerPC</td> <td>Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
  <tr><td>x86</td> <td>Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard)</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td> <td>Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion)</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td> <td>Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td> <td>Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)</td></tr>

</div>
<p>
We believe that it runs on any recent Linux distribute that has support for 32-bit
executables, as well as on BSD variants, SPARC/Solaris, and PPC/AIX, but we have not
tested these systems.
