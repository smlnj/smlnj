NAME
----
ml-burg - a tree parser generator for Standard ML

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ml-burg* 'file'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *ml-burg* program generates a *Standard ML* program to perform
bottom-up rewriting of an input tree. Cost information associated
with each rewrite rule is used to derive the minimum rewrite cost
for the entire tree. A successful reduction corresponds to rewriting
the input tree to a special non-terminal symbol called the
__start non-terminal__. Upon successful reduction, facilities are
provided to walk the tree emitting semantic actions corresponding to
the rules that matched.
