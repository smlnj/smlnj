NAME
----
heap2exec - generate standalone executable from a *SML/NJ* heap image.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*heap2exec* 'file'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Under normal usage, *SML/NJ* represents a program as a heap-image file
with a name of the form `foo.<arch>-<opsys>`, which is dynamically loaded
by the runtime system.  The *heap2exec* program is a tool for combining
a heap-image file and the runtime system into a single, standalone,
executable program.

Running the command `heap2exec foo` will convert the heap image file
`foo.<arch>-<opsys>` to an executable program named `foo`.
