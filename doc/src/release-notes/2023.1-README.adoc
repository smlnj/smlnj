=== 32-bit macOS issues

While the {dist-dir}smlnj-x86-{version}.pkg[x86 installer]
for {version} works on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave, building from source
requires some extra steps because the version of **Xcode**
distributed for Mojave does not include a 32-bit SDK.

Another issue that you may encounter
when building on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave is an error message for a shell
script of the form

.....
  /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted
.....

This error arises because the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is set on the
shell script.  To fix the problem, remove the attribute using the command

[source,shell]
-----
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine shell-script
-----
and resume the build.
