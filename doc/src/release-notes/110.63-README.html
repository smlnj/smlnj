<h3>Summary:</h3>

    This release is primarily a bugfix release.

<h3>Details:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>installer:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Eliminated any mention of lexgen.  (Lexgen was an early precursor
	to ml-ulex.)</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>command-line tools</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Fixed typo in ml-build script that prevented library anchors
	from being registered.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>SML Basis library:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Fixed a number of inconsistencies between the Posix.TTY structure
	and the Basis specification.  Thanks to Adam Chilpala.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>CM:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Fixed bug in CM's parallel make facility that failed to have
	the master re-link modules after letting slaves compile them.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>MLRISC:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	x86MCEmitter crashed when the immediate operand to MOVB was outside
	of the range -128 ... 127.   Only the low order 8 bits of the
	immediate operand are now significant.
      <p></li>
      <li>
	Added preliminary support in MLRISC for Staged Allocation, a technique
	for specifying calling conventions.  See
	<blockquote align="center">
		<a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/pubs/staged-abstract.html">
		<tt>http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/pubs/staged-abstract.html</tt></a>
	</blockquote>
	Initially, this mechanism is being used to generate C calls for the
	AMD64.
      <p></li>
      <li>
	Fixed bogus operand sizes in AMD64 instruction spilling.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

  <dt>runtime:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a problem with files that have very large numbers of literals.
	When SaveCState was called with two values to save, a subsequent
	GC could cause the RestoreCState to fail because the saved state had been
	promoted to tagless pair.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
