== Summary

This release is primarily a bug-fix release.  In particular, we have addressed some
of the teething issues in the new ARM64 support.

== Details

// **** details: include those sections that are relevant

=== Compiler

* changed the way that GC invocation code is generated to not distinguish between
  different types that have uniform representation (*i.e.*, `LABt`, `PTRt` and `TAGt`).
  This change results in significant shrinkage in the size of heap images and more
  closely matches the behavior of the old **MLRISC** code generator.

=== CM

=== MLRISC

=== Runtime System

=== Basis Library

* removed deprecated functions from `SMLofNJ.SysInfo` structure and changed the
  `WIN32` constructor to `WINDOWS`.

* added `charSize` and `realSize` functions to `Unsafe` structure to enable
  more compile-time feature tests.

=== SML/NJ Library

* moved the `JSON` structure from the *JSON* Library to the *Util* Library.  This
  change was made to allow code to produce/consume JSON values without depending
  on the *JSON* library.

=== Successor ML

=== ML-LPT

=== Documentation

=== Installation

== Bugs

Here is a list of the issues that are fixed (or closed) with this release.

We also fixed the following bugs that did not have issues
associated with them (or were bug fixes ported from the legacy
repository):
--
* Fixed a bug in the **arm64** assembly code for `Assembly.A.scalb`

* Fixed an infinite loop that could occur when clustering the first-order
  **CPS** functions prior to generating the **CFG** IR.

* Ported {legacy-issue}/347[Legacy Issue #347 (`Unsafe.cast` causes Compiler bug)]

* Merged {legacy-pull-base}/349[Legacy pull request #349 (`PackReal64Big`
  and `PackReal64Little` export internals)]

* Merged {legacy-pull-base}/351[Legacy pull request #351 (Fix `Word8Buffer.contents`
  to return an object with `ByteVector` representation)]
