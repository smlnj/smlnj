== Summary

This release is primarily a bug-fix release.  In particular, we have addressed some
of the teething issues in the new ARM64 support.

== Details

// **** details: include those sections that are relevant

=== Compiler

=== CM

=== MLRISC

=== Runtime System

=== Basis Library

* removed deprecated functions from `SMLofNJ.SysInfo` structure and changed the
  `WIN32` constructor to `WINDOWS`.

* added `charSize` and `realSize` functions to `Unsafe` structure to enable
  more compile-time feature tests.

=== SML/NJ Library

* moved the `JSON` structure from the *JSON* Library to the *Util* Library.  This
  change was made to allow code to produce/consume JSON values without depending
  on the *JSON* library.

=== Successor ML

=== ML-LPT

=== Documentation

=== Installation

repository):

* Fixed an infinite loop that could occur when clustering the first-order
  **CPS** functions prior to generating the **CFG** IR.

* Ported {legacy-issue}/347[Legacy Issue #347 (`Unsafe.cast` causes Compiler bug)]

* Merged {legacy-pull-base}/349[Legacy pull request #349 (`PackReal64Big`

  to return an object with `ByteVector` representation)]
