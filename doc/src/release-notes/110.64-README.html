</b><br/>
        This working version is believed to be stable, and 
        has passed the regression test suite. However, there is
        quite a bit of new code in the FLINT middle end and 
        at the interface between the Front End and FLINT.

<h3>Summary:</h3>

Many of the changes affect FLINT and its interaction with the
front end, and particularly the system for supporting primops
(primitive operations). Additional bugs have been fixed, and
ml-lpt as well as AMD64 support have been updated. 

<h3>Details:</h3>

<dl>

  <dt>Front End and FLINT:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Implemented a new scheme for defining primops and tracking
        and analyzing their types in the type checker and in FLINT.
        Improved the way that the type checker captures type
        information used by the translate phase to calculate 
        FLINT types.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved signature printing by making it faithfully reflect
        the original order of specifications or (for inferred
        signatures) definitions.
      </li>
      <li>
        First phase of streamlining the type system of the plambda and flint
        intermediate languages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed some bugs in the type checker and module system.
      </li>
      <li>
	Infinite loop in FLINT (<tt>tests/typing/tests/25.sml</tt>)
	(fix by Stefan Monnier).
      </li>
      <li>
	Implemented integer and word division operations (div, mod,
	rem, quot) with an explicit test for zero division.  This
	fixes several previously open bugs related to the treatment of
	divide-by-zero errors.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>SML Basis library:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Fixed a bug in the implementation of order operations
        and min and max for Int32. Fixed several other bugs in the Basis
        that were revealed by running the regression tests.
      </li>
      <li>
	A number of fixes related to the formatting of dates.  These
	include fixes for bugs #1415 and #1416.  We also now correctly
	handle format characters that lie outside the specified set.
      </li>
      <li>
	Timer.cpu_timer, etc. type printing corrected (by making Timer
	have opaque sig constraint in <tt>basis/Implementation/timer.sml</tt>)
      </li>
      <li>
	Added missing <tt>toLarge</tt>/<tt>fromLarge</tt> operations to <tt>Word</tt><i>N</i> modules.
      </li>
      <li>
	Added missing <tt>InvalidArc</tt> to <tt>OS.Path</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
	Fixed bug in printing negative time values.
      </li>
      <li>
	<tt>Char.fromString</tt> now handles the <tt>\u</tt><i>xxxx</i> escape sequence.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>CM:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Added a boolean control named cm.tolerate-tool-failures
	(env. variable name: CM_TOLERATE_TOOL_FAILURES).  The default
	is false and makes CM fail if a shell tool reports a
	non-success exit status.  If the control is set to true, then
	CM will press on after tool failures in the event that all
	target files exist (even when some of them are considered
	outdated).  Turning the control to true can be useful for
	bootstrapping.
      </li>
      <li>
	Changed the installation mechanism for CM tool plugins.  These
	are just libaries and now get installed like ordinary
	libaries.<br/>

	There are now a number of new installation targets that give
	some fine-grain control over what classes and suffixes are
	known, and what they will map to.  See config/targets for
	details.<br/>

	The code that caused plugin installation as part of running a
	tool's "build" script has been removed.  (The build script is for
	building, not for installing.)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>SML/NJ Library</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Added <tt>next</tt> function to <tt>Fifo</tt> and <tt>Queue</tt> modules.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>ml-lpt:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	The name of several ml-lpt-lib modules has changed:
	<pre>
	  Repair	=> AntlrRepair
	  StreamPos	=> AntlrStreamPos
	  ErrHandlerFn	=> AntlrErrHandler
	  EBNF		=> AntlrEBNF
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
	The ml-antlr specification format has changed: declarations such as
	%tokens and nonterminal definitions can occur *multiple* times in the
	same specification.  The semantics are such that each new
	declaration extends the previous ones.  This does not apply to
	%start or %name, of course.
      </li>

      <li>
	Importing a grammar via %import now includes <em>all</em>
	declarations in from the imported grammar, except for %name,
	%entry, and %start.  Tokens and nonterminals can be dropped
	using the new %dropping clause of the
	%import directive; the separate %drop and %extend have been
	removed.
      </li>

      <li>
	We now allow optional type annotations on nonterminals, using
	the %nonterms directive as in ml-yacc.
      </li>

      <li>
	The refcell construct is now implemented using SML's regular
	reference cells, so the :== and !! notation has been
	deprecated.
      </li>

      <li>
	The ml-antlr tool now does much more checking of
	specifications, and its error messages have been greatly
	improved.  Error repair for generated parsers has been
	completely rewritten, and is now both much faster and more
	accurate.
      </li>
      <li>
	ml-ulex is now more lenient with escape codes
	(non-SML-standard escape codes are now interpreted literally,
	so e.g. \| denotes "|").  Also, character classes may now
	include a "-" character at the beginning as is standard in
	most other regexp tools.
      </li>
      <li>
	All of these changes are documented in the user guide, which
	has been updated and improved.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>AMD64 support:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Added the new MLRISC code generator for the AMD64.  This
	version, in contrast to the previous one, uses SSE registers
	and instructions for all floating-point computations.
      </li>
      <li>
	Added FSQRT instructions for the AMD64 code generator.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>Regression Tests:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Revised the regression test suite and brought the tests and
        reference outputs up to date. Added a few new tests. Cleaned
        up the test scripts.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
