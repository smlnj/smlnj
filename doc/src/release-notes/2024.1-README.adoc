== Summary

=== Compiler

=== MLRISC

=== Runtime System

=== Basis Library

* Complete rewrite of the mechanisms used to implement conversions
  between strings and reals.  As part of this rewrite, we implemented the
  support for the `StringCvt.EXACT` formatting mode and implemented the
  missing `Real.toDecimal`/`fromDecimal` functions.  The real-string
  conversions is based on the https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu[Ryu library]
  and associated https://doi.org/10.1145/3296979.3192369[PLDI paper]
  by Ulf Adams.

* Added missing implementation of `Real64.nextAfter` function.

* Added `Unsafe.Real64` structure that implements bit casts between
  double-precision reals and 64-bit words.
