SrcPath Notes:

1. The design seems to be meant to accomodate possible changes in the underlying file system
   (e.g. maybe renaming and deleting files, directories, changing the current working
    directory) while maintaining "validity" of the internal CM representations (of files).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Lots of values, datastructure components are "suspended" or represented by thunks.
   Was this for "efficiency", or to try to insulate from changes occuring in the file system?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. How much of the "tolerance" of background change is actually being used or is really justified?
   I can see how avoiding dependence on the current working directory would be good, i.e. refering
   to files by paths relative to the current working directory.  But it seems exessive to try to
   accomodate things like someone in the background renaming or deleting files, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Is there a reason why srcpath-lib.cm should not import from util-lib.cm?  (e.g. to use Say.say)
   Nope! It is already importing StringMap from util.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. There are six "representations" for files:

   1. fpath strings (using the "OS-indepent" notation used in OS.FileSys and OS.Path),

   2. path: a structure similar to the record that OS.Path.fromString produces, but with arcs
      in reverse order (deepest arc first),

   3. dpath: a base directory (type dir), originally called the "context", plus a relative path
      (list of arcs) from that directory in outer-to-inner order,

   4. fileInfo: the information in a dpath (dir, arcs) plus
        (1) an elab ref and
        (2) an "id :FileId.id option ref", initially NONE, but reset to SOME FileId.id by intern
	    and sync, where the FileId.id is derived from the actual OS-FS file_id if it exists,

   5. file: fileInfo plus a "stableid" integer (an "interned" fileInfo),

   6. "elab": a path plus a validity flag and a "reanchor" function (whatever that does).
      elabs can be generated from other representations (e.g. dpath) with initial valid value true.
      They can be "invalidated" if their associated env binding is

There is a lot of redundancy among these six ways of representing files, and several of them
are translatable into each other. The fileInfo, file, and elab types could be considered a bit more
"semantic" (i.e. deeper) because they involve a bit more than a purely syntactic description.
The purpose of the valid and reanchor components of an elab is not clear.

There is also a the DIR variety of the dir datatype that has an associated fileInfo, so dir values
can indirectly involve a file.

Could this multiplicity of file representations be simplified?  How many different represenations do
we really need? Note that dpath, file, and dir are the only ones exported by the SRCPATH signature,
and the only representations present in the exported val types are string, dpath, file, and dir.
Thus fileInfo, elab, and path are only used internally in SrcPath.

There is a couple progressions:

     fpath (string) --[OSP.fromString]--> path --[pathToFpath]--> fpath

     dpath --[intern?]--> fileInfo (adding undefined file-id)
             --[intern?]--> file (adding stableid and defining file-id)

Where do dpaths come from?  Where is the link between paths and dpaths?

Dpaths are created (directly) by the function decodeFpath [-> parseFpath], which (with the
help of the env) translates fpaths directly to (interned) files.  There is no direct
translation from the syntactic fpath/path representations to the dpath representation, or
in particular, to the dir type.  It is also not clear whether the id field of a fileInfo
record is relevant for working with DIR values.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. There are two mappings over anchors, both incorporated into the env type:

   1. The implicit string map (anchorMapRef) of an env is operated on by the get, set,
      defined, and reset components of the env record. This maps anchors (strings) to
      pairs of dpaths and "validity" flags (bool ref). The validity flag is by default
      true, but can be set false either by the set function, when rebinding an anchor that
      is already mapped, or wholesale by the reset function. These validity flags are
      (assumed to be) shared with elab records (associated with the anchor).

      The set function (formerly set_free) can add new bindings of anchors to the map, or
      "rebind" an anchor that was already in the domain of the map, while "invalidating"
      the old binding by setting its validity flag to false.

      The get function, if applied to a mapped anchor (i.e. an anchor in the domain of !anchorMapRef)
      will return an elab generated from the (path, validity) that the anchor maps to.
      When get is applied to an anchor that is not mapped, it causes a fatal error.

      So the "validity" flag associated with an anchor (in the !anchorMapRef map) will be set
      false when a binding of the anchor is removed (or overwritten) in the map by set or reset.

   2. The bound field of an env record is a mapping from anchors to a dpath (formerly an
      "anchorval"). Bindings are added to this mapping by the bind function, which
      operats "functionally" on an env record, producing a modified env. Bindings in the
      "bound" mapping are looked up (via StringMap.find) only in the lookAnchor function.

   Thus env is both an statefull environment "object" whose state consistes of the mapping stored
   in its anchorMapRef ref cell, and it is a functional environment (where binding new anchors produces
   a "new" environment with respect to the "bound" component. But the new env record returned by the
   bind function shares its state with the bind argument env.  Both aspects of the env are used in
   the lookAnchor function, which consults first the bound environment and if that fails, it consults
   the anchorMapRef mapping (i.e. the env state mapping).  This dual nature seems quite odd.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. There is also an implicit map (now called FileInfoMap, formerly F0M) mapping
   fileInfo records to stableid int values based on the id field (FileId.id) of the
   fileInfo.

   The implicit fileInfo to stableid mapping is stored in a local ref ("known").

   Since the initial default id values in the fileInfo records are NONE, the intern
   operation will (through calling getFileId) redefine the info field in terms of an actual
   file system file_id (mediated through FileId.id).

   The fileInfo map is built and operated on by three functions: clear, intern, and sync.

      clear: resets the "known" ref to the empty map

      intern: generates a new (sequenctial) stableid integer value and binds it in the map
        and combines it with its fileInfo argument to return an "interned" file. If it is a
	new fileInfo key (presumably with id = ref NONE), its binding will be inserted into the map
	using fileInfoSidMap.insert, which will call getFileId, which will redefine the id field using
	the actual OS.FileSys file_id (actually PRESENT (file_id) or ABSENT fpath depending on
        whether the the file actually exists in the file system (?)).

      sync: resets the id field of all currently mapped fileInfo's to NONE (thus invalidating them?)
        and rebuilds a new fileInfoSidMap with the same (now invalidated!) fileInfos as keys.
	This "works" because the map insert function uses getFileId on the fileInfo keys, and this
	will generate new id values for the invalidated keys. Thus syn replaces the original
	file id (fileInfo.id) with actual file system file ids produced by OS.FileSys.fileId.

	The file_ids used in the reconstructed mapping will normally be the same as the file_ids
	used when a fileInfo record is interned. [When might they differ?]
	[So, is sync normally a no-op having no discernable effect?]


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. reanchor -- one of the compononets of an "elab"

      val reanchor: (anchor -> string) -> path option

   Takes a conversion function mapping an anchor to a string (normally a fpath?) and returns a
   path option.  In most cases this is initialized to a trivial (fn _ => NONE): for instance:

     bogus_elab,
     absoluteElab

   Where is the reanchor component of an elab actually applied?

   osstring_reanchored (only application)

    fun osstring_reanchored cvt file =
	let val {reanchor, ...} = fileToElab file
	 in Option.map (FI.canonical o pathToFpath) (reanchor cvt)
	end

   osstring_reanchored is exported from SrcPath and used only once, in main/filename-policy:

    (* separate_generic : {bindir: string, bootdir: string} -> policy *)
    (* SP = SrcPath *)
    fun separate_generic { bindir: string, bootdir: string } =
	let fun shiftname (root: string) (file: SP.file) =
		let fun anchor_cvt (anchor: string) = OS.Path.concat (root, anchor)
		 in case SP.osstring_reanchored anchor_cvt file
		      of SOME s => s
		       | NONE => (Say.say ["Failure: ", SP.descr p,
					   " is not an anchored path!\n"];
				  EM.impossible "separate-generic -- bad path")
		end
	 in mkPolicy (shiftname bindir, shiftname bootdir, true)
	end

     Initial reanchor values:

         (fn () => NONE)   -- trivial default

       env.get initialization:

         (fn (cvt: string -> fpath) => SOME (fpathToPath (cvt anchor))

     Anchor "tranforms":

       osstring_dpath_reanchored:

	 fun osstring_reanchored cvt file =
	     let val {reanchor, ...} = fileToElab file
	      in Option.map (FI.canonical o pathToFpath) (reanchor cvt)
	     end

       parentElab:

         fun parentElab ({ pp, reanchor }: elab) : elab  =
	     { pp = parentPath pp,
	       reanchor = Option.map parentPath o reanchor }

      extendElab:

	 fun extendElab arcs { pp, reanchor } =
	     { pp = extendPath arcs pp,
	       reanchor = Option.map (extendPath arcs) o reanchor }


   A datatype to encode the reanchor construction

      datatype reanchor  (* relative to an anchor *)
        = Anchor of anchor
        | Parent of reanchor
        | Extend of string list (*arcs*) * reanchor

      (* applyReanchor : (string -> fpath) -> reanchor -> path *)
      fun applyReanchor (cvt: string -> fpath) reanchor =
        case reanchor
	  of Anchor of anchor => fpathToPath (cvt anchor)
           | Parent of reanchor => parentPath (applyReanchor cvt reanchor)
           | Extent of (arcs, reanchor) => extendPath arcs (applyReanchor cvt reanchor)

      Actually, parentPath and extendPath operate only on the revarcs component of a path,
      leaving the vol and isAbs fields alone, so possibly the Parent case could just do a
      tl and the Excend case could just do an append (or revAppend) on the revarcs of the
      relevant paths ("on the way out" after having recursed down to the anchor in the
      final Anchor node (Anchor a) to which the cvt : string -> fpath is applied to give
      the new "anchor point".

      The reanchor encodes a kind of "file system delta" down the path from an anchor
      point to a file that is located relative to that anchor (i.e. relative to an ANCHOR
      dir). We "apply" the reanchor to translate an anchor-relative path to a new (full)
      path relative to a shifted location of the anchor point given by the cvt function.

      The Parent constructor for reanchor is used in only one place, to trim the arcs for
      a DIR directory given by its fileInfo.  This may because of the way the DIR is introduced
      in the decodeFpath [decode] function, where DIRs seem to serve to link "segments".
      [Have to understand what is going on in decodeFpath better. Don't yet understand
       segments and the need to adjust arcs using a Parent reanchor in dirToReanchor.

   A couple things I still don't understand about reanchors and DIRs:

      * Why do we use the Parent reanchor to trim the last (innermost) arc when computing
        the (potential) reanchor for a DIR?

      * What are segments and why do they exist?  [in fun processFpath]
        How are DIRs used to "link" segments together?
	Examples?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Phase 3 simplification

  The main change is to separate the two anchor environments embodied in the env type,
  namely the anchor --> path environment (a "stateful" mapping), and the
  anchor --> dpath environment (the "bound" component of an env).

  Since newEnv is called in only two places to create new "env" environments
  (once in main/cm-boot.sml and once in bootstrap/btcompile.sml), and since these
  environments do not "co-exist" in a given CM process, it seems likely that the
  anchor --> path environment can be implemented as a "global" stateful resource
  embodied in a structure PathEnv inside SrcPath and used only locally.
  Most functions in the SrcPath signature that took an env parameter can instead
  internally access the path environment through the PathEnv structure and
  no longer need an env parameter. [The exceptions are lookAnchor and bind, which
  still need to access the dpath environment.]

  The anchor --> dpath environment (the "bound" component of an env record),
  on the other hand, is treated functionally and can be given its own type with
  operations "bind" to add bindings and "lookAnchor" to access the environment to
  produce ANCHOR directories for a given anchor.

  There remains the question of whether we actually need two different anchor
  environments.

  Note that paths and dpaths could both be considered representations of locations
  in the file system (like fpaths, which are the "raw" form of file system locations).
  But dpaths contain dir components as the root of a arc list path, and the dir
  type expresses some of the "semantics" relevant to CM (i.e. paths relative to
  the root (ROOT), or the current working directory (CWD), or an anchor (ANCHOR) or
  relative to a directory (DIR) (?).

  A remaining mystery to be cleared up is the notion of "segments" in a fpath
  (separated by the #":" character) and how these are process to create dir values
  and dpaths in the decodeFpath (formerly "decode") function. This gives rise
  to the need for a Parent constructor for the reanchor type, whose role is unclear
  to me. It would simplify reanchoring if this constructor could be eliminated.

  Conjecture: the fileInfos created in decodeFpath designate CDFs. Then the Parent
  delta in the associated reanchors gives the relative path to the directory containing
  the CDF, and then the further reanchoring will be applied relative to that directory
  containing the CDF, not to the relative path of the CDF.

  An example: one place where decode[Fpath] is called is in cm-boot.sml, where it
  is applied to "fpaths" that are found at the beginning of lines in the PIDMAP
  file.  Here is an example of a "segmented" fpath found in PIDMAP:

    $SMLNJ-LIB/PrettyPrint/prettyprint-lib.cm:src/prettyprint.cm

  Note that the path for prettyprint.cm should be something like

    $SMLNJ-LIB/PrettyPrint/src/prettyprint.cm

  So if in decodeFpath, the first segment is a DIR with arcs

    ["PrettyPrint", "prettyprint-lib.cm"]

  then this can be "Parent'ed" to ["PrettyPrint"] before being Extend'ed to

    ["PrettyPrint", "src", "prettyprint.cm"]

  So it looks like whatever is generating the PIDMAP file can produce such "segmented"
  file paths.  Is this is the only source of segmented file paths?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Phase 4 simplification

* Rename "file location" types:

    path = string list (arc list, with arcs ordered from outer to inner)
    rpath = string list (reverse arc list, with arcs ordered from inner to outer)
    fpath = string (file paths in some "standard" format)

    prepath -> path (for "abstract path")
    prefile -> dpath (for "directory-based" path)

** fpath (assume OS = unix for discussion, FS = OS file system)

  The fpath format is a bit ambiguous. I think it would be correct to say that
  this includes "normal" absolute and relative (canonical?) paths, as described in
  the OS.Path Basis documentation, plus file paths starting with an anchor (a non-empty
  arc string preceded by the #"$" character). Internally we should assume that we are
  working with cannonical paths, but user-specified paths may not be cannonical.

  A relative fpath must be interpreted relative to some implicit file system "directory",
  by default the current working directory (CWD).

  Non-relative fpaths may be "absolute", meaning that they start from the root directory
  (ROOT "": dir), or anchored, meaning that they start from a directory designated
  by an anchor name.

  It is assumed that in an fpath, parsed into arcs, all but the last arc will "designate"
  a directory, with respect to which the following arc will be interpreted.

** path (aka prepath).

  This is a sort of "abstract" file path. The property of being absolute or relative is
  given by the "isAbs" field, and if absolute it is rooted as the volume designated by the
  "vol" field. If the last (innermost) arc is an anchor (starts with "$"), then we assume
  that the path is relative (what would "/$a" mean?).  Only the innermost arc (last element
  of revarcs) should be an anchor arc (what would $a/b/$c mean?).

  Note that it is trivial to map back and forth between fpaths and paths.  Given canonicalization
  of paths, these location representations are isomorphic.

** dpath ("directory-based" path, aka prefile)

  The arcs are interpreted relative to the "dir" component. In the case of the CWD, ROOT,
  and ANCHOR dir variants, it seems clear what this means (these should correspond with
  CWD-relative, absolute, and anchor-relative file paths).

  The DIR variant is more complicated. DIR constructors serve to append, or chain, the arc-paths
  of the current "directory" point with those of another, predecessor, dpath, except that the
  predicessor path may (usually, always) actually designates a nondirectory file, such as a
  CDF (CM description file).

     dpath0 = D0 % a % b % c  =  {dir = D0, arcs = ["a", "b, "c"]}

     dpath1 = {dir = dpath0, arcs = ["d", "e"]}

  Here it will be the case that <D0>/a/b/c is not a directory, but <D0>/a/b will be,
  and

     dpath1 ~~ <D0>/a/b/d/e = {dir = D0, arcs = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]}

  Example: the segmented path

     $SMLNJ-LIB/PrettyPrint/prettyprint-lib.cm:src/prettyprint.cm

  found in a PIDMAP file, is decoded into the dpath

     {dir = {dir = A0, arcs = ["PrettyPrint", "prettyprint-lib.cm"]},
      arcs = ["src", "prettyprint.cm"]}

     ==>

     {dir = A0, arcs = ["PrettyPrint", "src, "prettyprint.cm"]}

  where

     A0 = ANCHOR {name = "SMLNJ-LIB",
                  path = </User/dbm/sml/Dev/github/smlnj/smlnj-lib>,
		  dpathOp = NONE(?)}

  Note: DIR seems like a slightly misleading constructor name, since DIR constructs
  may not, or generally do not, correspond with directories. The usual situation is that
  they are "links" of a sort to extend the previous dir at (or near) the end of a previous
  dpath (down a path from a "parent" dir).

  There is another conceptual mismatch, since an ANCHOR would seem to designate a directory
  that is the anchor point of its anchor (found at its path).  But DIR seems to designate
  a file (generally/always a CDF).  Of course CWD and ROOT dirs obviously are associated
  with directories.

** "anchor points", anchor environments

  I will call the FS location designated by an anchor the "anchor point" for that anchor,
  and it can be described by an fpath, an path, or a dpath.

  There is a global, "base" environment mapping anchor strings to the corresponding
  anchor point represented by an path. This global environment is implemented by the
  PathEnv structure, whose interface consists of the functions

     get : anchor -> path option         -- NONE if not bound
     set : anchor * path option -> unit  -- bind, rebind, or remove an anchor from the environment
     defined : anchor -> bool	          -- is the anchor bound in the evironment
     reset : unit -> unit		  -- reset the global environment to the empty environment

  This environment obviously uses paths to designature the anchor point of an anchor.

  The second form of anchor environment is given by the type dpathEnv, which the the type
  of "functional" environments that map anchors to dpaths.

  My conjecture is that the dpathEnv environments are used to implement "temporary" or
  "dynamic" bindings associated with "bind" declarations in CFDs. Both environments are
  accessed in the lookAnchor function, where the dpathEnv parameter has precedence over the
  global PathEnv environment.

  An obvious question is why the global environment maps to paths and the "dynamic" or
  local environments map to dpaths? Why couldn't they both map to the same kind of
  file-locator type?

  Note that it is fairly easy to map from dpaths to paths (see the dpathToPath function).
  But no inverse function that maps paths to dpaths is defined, though one could use a variant
  of the decodeFpath function to map from paths to dpaths with the helpe of a dpathEnv,
  which is "needed" to create ANCHOR dirs for anchor arcs (& anchored paths).
  It is obvious that anchor environments are relevant to translating anchored paths (or fpaths)
  to dpaths, which have to include dir components. So a translation function mapping dpaths to
  paths probably must require a dpathEnv argument.

  A related question is: Why do the ANCHOR dir values need both an path and a dpath (optional)?
  This appears to be simply because the anchor point of an ANCHOR dir may come from either
  the global PathEnv environment, or a local dpathEnv environment.


* Interning, creating files

  Earlier versions had a "fileInfo" type which was a precursor type for the file type.

  In this version of clarified SrcPath, we dispense with fileInfo and build "incomplete"
  or preliminary files.  A file is a record contining 3 fields

     dpath: dpath -- the location of the file (would path work as well?)
     fid: FileId.id option ref -- a place to put the actual FS file_id if it exists
          (via FileId)
     sid: stableid -- the integer stable it, generated for the file in the intern function

  Preliminary representations of files ("prefiles"?) are built with "dummy" values
  for fid (ref NONE) and sid (0, an out-of-range stable id value, because < 1).
  See dpathToFile.

  The intern function is based on a stateful set of interned files (known : FileSet.set ref).
  When a file (or "prefile"?) is interned the first time, its file_id is determined
  (via FileId, using OS.FileSys.fileId) and stored in the fid field, and a new stableid is
  generated and stored in the sid field. The intern function returns the completed file.

  The "sync" funcion "rebuilds" this set of interned files. [Why does this need to be done?]


* Reanchors and reanchoring

  See comments in the code.  Reanchors are built primarily from files (actually the
  dpaths of files).  They are used map to new paths/fpaths given a new anchor to
  path/fpath association.

* What has been discarded

  - elab

  - fileInfo

  - reanchor as an elab component (functional representation)
      (now a computed attribute of a file or dpath)

  - the "combined" env, now split into PathEnv environment (state) and the dpathEnv
    type.  dpathEnv environments behave "functionally" (based on StringMap).

  - prepath, prefile renamed to path, dpath

  - We are down to 3 ways of specifying FS locations: fpath, path, dpath.  It is still
    unclear to me why we need both path and dpath.

* Has any essential functionality been lost?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Phase 5 Simplification: Eliminating dpaths [prefiles] and the dir datatype.

This version is an attempt to simplify the file "location paths" down to only fpaths and paths,
eliminating dpaths [formerly prefiles].

This is a significant simplification suggested by the fact that using both paths [prepaths]
and dpaths [prefiles] seems to be redundant.

Eliminating dpaths [prefiles] implies that we can also eliminate the dir datatype.

Most of the functions mapping from and to dpaths can be deleted. There are several
functions that involve dir and dpaths that can either be deleted or become fairly trivial,
including:

    dpathToString
    pickle
    unpickle
    osstring_dpath_relative
    osstring_relative

The DIR constructor for the dir type seems to be used to create what I will call
"segmented paths", and these paths are represented in the fpath (string) form by
a concatentation of fpath segments separated by the colon character.  So far, I have found
such segmented paths used in the PIDMAP file, but there may be other uses.

The decodeFpath function deals with these segmented paths internally, and produces a file,
which formerly could have a "segmented" dpath involving DIR segmentation. If "segmented paths"
are really essential, I believe they might be "simulated" by using a list of paths, with one
path for each segement, and where all but the first segment would be relative.

Again the question is whether functionality that is essential for SrcPath clients is
lost in this simplification (i.e. did the simplification "overshoot" it goal?).
My conjecture is that any essential functionality could be recovered without needing to
reintroduce the dir type and the dpath [prefile] type. If we really need "segmented" paths,
it might be enough to model them as lists of paths, where all but the last path in the
list must be relative.

It is clear how to translate a dpath of the form {dir = ROOT vol, arcs} into an path:

    {dir = ROOT vol, arcs}  -->  {isAbs = true, vol = vol, arcs = arcs}

But what about the {dir = CWD, arcs} and the {dir = ANCHOR _, arcs} forms?

    {dir = CWD, arcs}  -->  {isAbs = false, vol = "", arcs = arcs}

If we can assume (in general) that relative paths are always relative the the CWD.
For the anchor variant of dpath, how about

    {dir = ANCHOR{name, ...}, arcs}  --> {isAbs = false, vol = "", revarcs = rev ("$"^name :: rev revarcs)}

or can there be absolute anchored paths? Example?  ["/$anchor/..." doesn't seem to make
sense as an anchored path.]

Conversely, should path of the forms:

   {isAbs = true, vol, revarcs = [ ... , $name]}

   {isAbs = _, vol, revarcs = [..., $name, ..., arc]}

be considered ill-formed and illegal?  That is, can only the last element of revarcs by an anchor?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Phase 6: Classifying paths, translating paths to and from strings (fpaths)

Let's start by assuming there are just 3 kinds of paths, which are intended to denote file
locations in Unix/Windows file systems:

(a) Absolute paths, rooted at "/" (Unix) or "%volume" (Windows).

(b) Relative paths, with a unique, well-defined, but implicit root, say CWD.

(c) Anchor-rooted paths, with an anchor as root "$name/...". The anchor represents a
    definite but possibly variable FS location (defined by an absolute path) via
    an anchor enviornments that maps anchors (anchor names) to (absolute?) paths

We can fully abstract and separate the type structure of paths from their representation as
strings, using the following types:

  type anchor = string  -- non-empty

  type arc = string     -- non-empty, alphanumberic with initial letter, disallowing ".", and ".."

  type arcs = string list  -- possibly empty

  datatype root
    = U            -- unique Unix FS root directory
    | W of string  -- per-volume Windows roots (where the _non-empty_ string is the volume name)

  datatype head
    = ABS of root
    | REL of word  -- implicit root, defaulting to CWD, possibly empty arcs,
                   -- int is up-levels (i.e. the number of leading ".." arcs in standard path strings)
    | ANC of anchor

  type path = head * arcs

For arc names, the strings should be restricted to non-empty, alphanumeric strings starting with a
letter. It is recommended that they be lower-case, to deal with the problem of case-insensitive
file systems (like that of macOS). [The same rule should apply, of course, to the file
and directory names used in a CM-managed SML source tree.]

The REL constructor takes a count of initial "up" links (".." arcs in standard notation). This
count gives the number of "parent" steps before applying the arcs.  Thus

  REL (2, ["a", "b"])  <=>  "../../a/b"

We do this to sepate the notion of parent "up-links" from ordinary "downward leading" arcs. It is
a kind of pun to treat parent links as arcs (leading to things like /a/b/c/../d/../e". Same for
"current" arcs ("."). [The "current arc" as a path becomes "@0//" in the concrete syntax proposed
below]. Path values will thus not need to be "canonicalized".

We make the following assumptions about the file paths (canonical fpaths):

  * parent links ("..") only occur as an initial prefix of a file path's arcs, but there can be
    multiple such,
  * for absolute and anchored arcs lists, there are no parent links (only downward arcs),
  * there are no "current" links (there is no such thing in the representation).

Informally, we can call the values of this path type, "CM paths".  But type name can
simply be "path", replacing "apath" [formerly "prepath/prefile"], since there is only one
internal kind of path. Note that this definition of path replaces _both_ prepath, which was
a variant of the record representation produced by OS.Path.fromString, and prefile. The
_head_ type is analagous to the previous _dir_ type, with the exception of the dropped DIR
constructor, which was concerned with representing "segmented" paths.

At this point, it is unclear whether "segmented" paths have to be handled in a first-class way.
They are now handled internally in the parseFpath [decode] function.  Only after looking at
the way client modules depend on SrcPath can we determine whether segmented paths have to be
"visible" outside SrcPath.


* "Concrete" syntaxes of file paths (parsing fpaths and unparsing paths)

Now there is the problem of defining string path formats that can be unambiguously
parsed into these paths, and an unparse function that produces cannonical strings from
paths.  Ideally, it would be nice to have functions

  val parse : string -> path
  val unparse : path -> string

that were inverses, such that

  parse (unparse p) = p  for all paths p

  unparse (parse fp) = fp  for all (valid, canonical) file paths fp

We assume that the normal or usual file path notations are extended to included anchored paths and
the "$/a" abbreviation convention. We also can assume that anchored paths should always denote
files (CDFs) rather than FS directories.

There appear to be two different, but similar file path notations that are called "native"
and "standard" (presumably parsed by [native] and [standard] parsing functions.  It
appears that the "native" notation is (roughly) the notation produced by the
OS.Path.toString function (the OS.Path unparsing function). The "standard" notation seems
to allow OS variants like using "A:/a/b" and "a\b\c" in Windows as well as the Unix
conventions, and it appears to be able to "deal with" nonstandard notations for the parent
and current arcs. So the "standard" syntax could be viewed as a union of Unix and Windows
file path syntaxes (and it seems to support hybrid paths like "a/b\c").

To make things even more confusing, the parseFpath [decode] function parses the additional
syntactic feature of "%vol" for (Windows) volume names at the head of a file path.

QUESTION: What exactly is the file path concrete syntax that is to be used in CDFs?  Is it
  the "native", or "standard" or the syntax handled by the parseFpath [decode] function?

Now the type fpath is a bit ambiguous or underdefined, since it may refer to a string using
one of two or three different syntaxes for file paths.  Can we make it unambiguous?

QUESTION: There is also the question of whether file path parsing functions should
"expand" or "interpred" anchor arcs, replacing them with the file path (or path) bound to
the anchor in the current anchor environments (base or "dynamic"). The original "native",
"standard" and [decode] functions lazily looked up the anchor in the look functions that
were part of the ANCHOR dir that they produced, and which would be invoked in the elab_dir
function. But in our more direct representation there is the question of when to "expand"
anchor references, and then whether the expansion might itself be an anchored path requiring
iterated expansion (through environment lookups).

Currently these functions (native, standard, and parseFpath) perform a single expansion (or
anchor replacement) on anchored paths.

QUESTION: Can anchor environments map an anchor to an anchored path? [In which case,
  anchor expansion may be or should be iterative, until a non-anchored path is produced.]

* An alternate concrete syntax for file paths

We could also consider defining a simpler, unambiguous string notation for paths, avoiding
"overloading" of symbols like "/", avoiding problems related to special arcs like ".", ".."
and empty arc strings.

The string notation for paths does not have to coincide with the native file path notation
of any OS. So here is a new file path "concrete syntax" notation that might be used to
denote paths in CDFs an alternative to "native" or "standard" notation.

  val slash = "/"
  val slash2 = "//"  -- separator between a path's head and the path's arcs
  val ampersand = "&"
  val percent = "%"
  val at = "@"
  val dollar = "$"

  dec unparse_arcs : arcs -> string
  fun unparse_arcs arcs = interleave slash arcs

     unparse_arcs ["a", "b", "c"] = "a/b/c"
     unparse_arcs [] = ""

  dec unparse_root : root -> string
  fun unparse_root U = amp
    | unparse_root (W vol) = percent ^ vol

  dec unparse_head : head  -> string
  fun unparse_head (ABS root) = unparse_root root
    | unparse_head (REL up) = ampersand ^ wordToString up
    | unparse_head (ANC anchor) = dollar ^ anchor

  dec unparse_path : path -> string
  fun unparse_path (head, arcs) = unparse_head head ^ unparse_arcs arcs

The valid path strings would be exactly the range/image of unparse_path over the domain of all
paths (all possible values of type path). This would elimate having to deal with
"noncanonical" path strings containg special arcs like "." and "..". Avoiding these
problematical arc names could be achieved by restricting arcs to alphanumberic strings
starting with a letter (like SML identifiers).

The definitions are also meant to avoid difficulties arising from empty path names, disallowing
paths like "a//b".

Call these the valid path strings (in this new string format).

Examples and nonexamples:

  "&//"        Unix root directory, empty arcs list ["/"]
  "&//a/b"     file at path a/b relative to the Unix root ["/a/b"]
  "%A//a/b/c"  file at path a/b/c relative to Windows volume "A"  ["A:a/b/c"]
  "@//a/b"     file at path a/b relative to CWD
  "@2//a/b"    file at path ../../a/b relative to CWD
  "$a//b/c"    file at path b/c relative to anchor_env("a")
  "a/b/c", "/a/b"  Invalid: paths must start with "&", "@", or "$"
  "@/a//c"     Invalid: empty arcs are not allowed
  "%A/a/b"     Involid: root must be followed by "//"

We could another separator like "#" instead of "//" to separate the "head" of a path from
its arcs. A single character separator would make parsing slightly simpler.

QUESTION: Could one interpret a REL path with respect to a "directory" (path)
  other than the implicit CWD?  How would a different implicit root for relative paths be
  designated or specified?  It seems that, like CWD, it would have to be part of the "state"
  of the program's file-system interface.

CLAIM: paths and valid path strings produced by these unparsing functions can be
translated unambiguously to Unix or Windows file paths


* Parsing path strings

CLAIM: [cannonical] Unix/Windows file paths can be parsed unambiguously to these CM paths.


Discussion:

There may be persuasive arguments not to use a new string format like the one proposed above
in CM description files, but to stick with conventional (OS based) file path notation, with the
addition of anchor names (of the form "$<name>") that are only permitted in certain places,
such as the first arc of a (relative) file path.  But the "externally allowed" file path notation
is only relevant to the initial parsing of CDFs and the reporting of errors.  Internally, we would
only need to use the path, etc. types.  I propose using these types (in place of path) in a
Phase 6 revision of srcpath.*.

There may be a need for an additional type of "segmented" paths, corresponding to the ":"
segmented path notation found in PIDMAP files (and possibly elsewhere?).

In general, we should be working whenever possible with the internal representation (the
abstract syntax) of paths (the type path), rather than file path strings.  Translating
paths from and to strings should only be done "at the edges", e.g. when parsing CDFs or
generating error messages.  Too many exported functions of SrcPath consume or produce
fpaths (string representations of file paths).  We should only need two: parsing and unparsing.

A 7th phase of simplification could git rid of redundant functions operating on fpaths.
For example, osstring_reanchored, which worked in terms of fpaths, has been replaced by
pathReanchored, which works with paths instead.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Phase 7: minimizing the use fpaths internally

This revision tries to restrict the uses of fpath (file path strings) to the "edge",
where they are parsed to internal paths or unparsed to strings (mainly for diagnostic
or error messages, or to create arguments to OS.FileSys or OS.Path functions that take
file path strings).

Manipulations of paths (like relativePath, mkAbsolute) have been rewritten to work
directly on paths rather than through OS.Path functions that take file path strings.

Many client modules should be revised to use paths rather than fpaths to the greatest
extent possible.

The SRCPATH signature has also been revised to organize types and functions into logical
clusters (e.g. parsing and unparsing file paths).

There remain a few of questions (and see also the questions above in None 12):

* When, if ever, might paths denote directories rather than nondirectory files?
* When, if ever, is it ok for a path to have an empty arc list?
* How many file path parsing functions do we really need?
  We now have 4: parseFpath, native, standard, parseSegmentedFpath.
* When should anchors be "expanded" when parsing file paths?
* Is is ok for anchors to map to anchored paths in the anchor environments?
* In general, when do anchors need to be "expanded"?
* Do segmented paths (as found sometimes in PIDMAP, and as parsed now in parseSegmentedFpath)
  need to be represented internally, as they were to some extent formerly with the prefile
  path?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Phase 8: reorganizing SrcPath

Preparation for possibly splitting out Path and File structures.

Slightly simplifying path pickling/unpickling, using string list rather than string list list.

Still unclear about what _really_ needs to be done about _native_ file path parsing.

Still unclear about why parseNative, parseStandard and parseSegmented file path parsing
functions need to take a pathEnv argument and use it to "expand" an anchor head.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
14. Phase 9: separating srcpath.sml into multiple structures: Path, File, SrcPath

  The SrcPath structure has beed broken into the following set of
  structures:

     Path: PATH  (cm/paths/dbm/path.s??)
     File: FILE  (cm/paths/dbm/file.s??)
     AnchorEnv: ANCHORENV  (cm/paths/dbm/anchorenv.s??)
     CharCode    (cm/paths/dbm/charcode.sml)  -- special characters <-> escape codes in strings
     FileMap     (cm/paths/dbm/filemap.sml)  -- was srcpathmap.sml (SrcPathMap)
     FileSet     (cm/paths/dbm/fileset.sml)  -- was srcpathset.sml (SrcPathSet)

  The residual SrcPath structure only deals with CWD maintenance and pathconfig file
  processing. These two functionalities could be made into separate structures.
  
  This notes file is now found at cm/paths/dbm/notes.txt (moved from the end of
  srcpath.sml).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
15. Some useful notation and path operations/relations

Assumption: a path can designate either a directory or a (source) file (including CDFs)

* Path extension

    path1 >> path2  -- path1 "extends" path2 (we can get path1 by adding arcs to path2)

    path1 = (head, arcs1), path2 = (head, arcs2), Exists rarcs. arcs1 = rarcs @ arcs2
            Say rarcs = arcs1 - arcs2.

    path1 >> path2 => path1 and path2 have the same head.
      If both are REL, then they are relative to the same base (typically CWD)
      Is the common base always a directory?

* Path "factoring"

    path1/path2  ==  If path1 >> path2, (path1 = (head, arcs1), path2 = (head, arcs2).
    		     then path1/path2 = (REL 0, arcs1 - arcs2);
		     otherwise, path1/path2 = path1 ?

* (Innermost) Directory of a path

    Dir (path) :  Dir (head, nil) = (head, nil)
    	          Dir (head, _::arcs) = (head, arcs)

  If a path p designates a CDF file, then the relative paths of members of the CDF file
  are relative to Dir p.

  is replaced by a pathEnv parameter.
