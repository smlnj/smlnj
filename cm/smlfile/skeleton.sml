 * The idea of skeletons is taken from the original SC (where they were
 * called "decl"s after one of the datatypes involved).
 * The new definitions used here are a lot simpler than the original ones;
 * they allow for a more succinct dependency analysis, and are easier to
 * pickle/unpickle.  Moreover, the ast->skeleton converter has been made
 * smarter -- resulting in smaller skeletons.
