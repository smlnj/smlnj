# Notes for new-arrays branch

For this branch, we are going to explore several changes to better
support the array, vector, and slice types.

See the [*Arrays, Vectors, and Slices*](https://github.com/smlnj/.github/wiki/Arrays,-Vectors,-and-Slices)
and [*New Primitives for Sequences*](https://github.com/smlnj/.github/wiki/New-Primitives-for-Sequences)
pages in the Wiki for some motivation and discussion..

## New primops

## Refactor assembly code

## Replace Assembly structure with dynamic linking

## Flat representations for slice and dynamic array headers
