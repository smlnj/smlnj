Library

  signature CM
  structure CM

is

  fetch-cm.sml

  (* The following two libraries are here to make sure that
   * pickling does not need to refer to host-compiler-0.cm.
   * This is an extremely *fragile* hack, but it significantly reduces
   * autoloading time for structure CM (as well as the system's
   * memory footprint).
   * The two libraries must be mentioned _first_ in order to take
   * advantage of CM's implicit priority scheme when it comes
   * to constructing the pickle environment for a library.
   * (The rule is that libraries that get mentioned early are
   * being favored.) *)
  $smlnj/basis/basis.cm
  $cm/paths/srcpath-lib.cm

  (* Here is the actual implementation... *)
  $smlnj/internal/cm-sig-lib.cm
  $smlnj/internal/cm0.cm
