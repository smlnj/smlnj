 *   the version of the SML/NJ pretty-printing library that is internally
 *   used by the implementation of the system itself.
 *
 *   User code can refer to it as $/pp-lib.cm, but the $pp-lib.cm
 *   anchor may be redefined to point to a different version
 *   without affecting the compiler itself.
