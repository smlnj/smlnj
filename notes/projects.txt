SMLNJ Related Projects
----------------------

Development/maintenance projects for the SML/NJ compiler, tools, and libraries

The following might be potential tasks for new volunteers joining the SML/NJ Fellowship.

1. Reimplementation of the (classic) SML/NJ match compiler
   [DBM: Done, 2021]

2. Design,implementation, and documentation of a new, improved prettyprinting library.
   [DBM: (Done), 2022-3]

3. Revamping and modernizing the SML/NJ type checker
   - improved type error messages
   - new treatment of type variables and type constructor variables
   - [[ equality polymorphism elimination? (while retaining "equality types")]]
   [DBM: 2023- ...]

4. Redesigning and reimplementing the SML/NJ module system
   - in conjunction with the reworking of the type system
   - Successor ML redesign
   - new formal semantics and its documentation
   - functor application "inlining" for optimization
   [DBM: 2023- ...]

5. Reimplementation and simplification of the FLINT type system
   - revision of hash-consing scheme
   - simplified approach to type closures (replacing semi-Nadathur closures)
   - elimination/replacement of deBruijn type variables
      (using only conventional "named" type variables)

6. Revision or replacement of the FLINT middle end
   - Reppy-Shivers plans?
   [JHR: ...]

7. Support of the Windows port of SML/NJ
   [updating, documentation, ...]

8. Simplification and documentation of the SML/NJ build process.

9. Revised compiler architecture
   - continuing evolution toward library-based compiler
   - more ballanced support for interactive system and batch compilation
   - more direct support for stand-alone SML applications

10. New memory management in runtime system
    [JRH: ongoing]

11. Preservation, maintenance, improvement of MLRISC code generation library
    [hedging the bet on llvm code generation]

12. RISCV code generator
    [llvm or MLRISC]

13. New or improved tools and libraries
    - HTML5 support
    - porting selected Python libraries?

14. Unicode characters and strings

15. Package [libraries] manager for libraries
    - Examples: Hackage for Haskell, OCaml package management?

16. Compiler distribution and installation
    - Platform compiler installers (Mac, Linux, Windows)
    - Linux package managers
    - improved support and documenation for building from source
    
17. Microsoft LSP (Language Server Protocol) support for SML/NJ
    - presume interacts with front-end representations (types, absyn)
      and therefore is impacted by projects 3 and 4.

18. Hand-made recursive descent parser with good syntax error messages.
