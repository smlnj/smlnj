How to hook up smlnj-lib/NEWPP so that it gets compiled and is accessible.

The idea is that PP and NEWPP will co-exist in smlnj-lib. If NEWPP becomes
accessible as a component of smlnj-lib (along with smlnj-lib/PP), then the
copy in smlnj[newpp]/compiler/Basics/newpp can be removed.

1. Added system/smlnj/smlnj-lib/newpp-lib.cm, a modified version of
   pp-lib.cm in the same directory that refers to smlnj-lib/NEWPP instead
   of smlnj-lib/PP (and NEWPP/newpp-lib.cm in place of PP/pp-lib.cm).
   [Q: why do we need (all)the bind: specifications in this cm description
   file?]

2. system/pathconfig: it looks like this does not need to be changed,
   because it does not define a root for the prettyprinter library.

3. Remove Basics/newpp entries from Basics/basics.cm (don't want to
   have duplicate sources loaded from Basics/basics.cm and
   system/smlnj/smlnj-lib/newpp-lib.cm.

3. What else? Is 1. all we really need to do?
