Notes on the compiler "component" CM libraries

[Desired] Dependency graph (skeleton, missing some import edges):

    TopLevel
       |
    CodeGen (CFG)
       |
      CPS
       |
     FLINT   Elaborate
       \      /
        \    /
       ElabData	   Parse
          |
        Basics

May possibly want a finer-grain library structure (E.g. break
up Basics into multiple libraries).


* Most of the libraries depend on toplevel.cm for Control. So TopLevel
  is also a common import!

* Should Control, ErrorMsg, Target be included in a new "low-level"
  library, maybe called Admin?  This would contain functionality that
  is not properly part of the compilation process.
  

  Admin/
    control/
      < Control: CONTROL
        Control_Print  (or PrintControl? : PRINTCONTROL)
        [what about ElabDataControl, etc.?]
        The "component" control structures will have "compiler-specific" control flags.

    errormsg/
      < ErrorMsg ...
      
    compiler/  ?
      < Target

    stats/

    source/ ?

  TopLevel should not be at the bottom of the dependency graph
  (because of Control)!  Moving Control into Admin would accomplish this.

* Basics/print should go away -- PrettyPrint should be used instead of
  "fancy" print formatting routines.
  -- prettyprint.sml, pputil.sig,sml are subsummed by PrettyPrint
  -- printutil.{sig,sml}: the other sequence printing and "string formatting" functions can
     also be replaced by PrettyPrint.
     [used mainly in obsolete printing code like printflint.sml]
  -- printcontrol.sml can be moved to Admin/control?
  

* TopLevel should be renamed. To what?
  It should be responsible for the interactive system, the so called
  REPL. This needs access to the whole chain: lexer, parser, elaborator,
  FLINT, CPS, NCG (IR optimization, code generation).

  Interact, REPL

* NewCodeGen should be renamed CodeGen? Or what?

* Basics/symbol should be moved to ElabData/basics (or whatever that
  is called).

* Basics/pid should also be moved to ElabData/basics.  (PersStamps, etc.)

* Basics/real -> ElabData/basics?

* "Basics" -> "Foundations" or "Common" or "Library"

* "LambdaVar" -> generic "Var"
   variables represented as integers, possibly "named"
   used for bound value variables in expressions, and another variety used for
   expression-level type variables, and another variety for module-level typcon variables

* ElabData/basics/debindex.* -> *  [delete]
   plan to eliminate the use of DeBruijn variables to types/type constructors in front end
   and FLINT.  In the meantime, use the concrete integers, etc.

* ElabData/basics/tkind.sml -> ? [FLINT]
   could temporarily move to ElabData/types.

* ElabData/basics/coresym.sml -> ? [a single special structure symbol "_Core"]
   probably belongs somewhere else, not a "generic" and "fundamental" compiler type

* ElabData/basics/sig-plist.sml (SigPropList)
   a property list used in the translation of modules (see FLINT/trans/module-plists.sml)
   Not generic or fundamental. Move (back) to FLINT/trans?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basics-Compiler: fundamental and/or "generic" types that are used in the compiler

symbol:
  symbol.{sig,sml} moved from Basics/symbol
  ...

paths:
  sympaths.{sig,sml}
  ppsympaths.sml
  pathname.sml (could/should be included in sympaths)
  
pids:
  PersStamps
  pid

"dynamic access"
  var.{sig,sml}  (LambdaVar is a special "instance" of generic variables)
  access.{sig,sml}

(generic) environments (over symbols)
  env.{sig,sml}

reals
  real-const.sml (from Basics/compiler)

ints
  int-const.sml (from Basics/compiler)

const-arith/ from Library)  

bignums/ (from Library)

extras that don't belong here
  debindex.{sig,sml}  -->  * (delete)
  pathname.sml --> sympath.sml  (integrate into sympath)
  sig-plist.sml --> FLINT/trans?
  tkind.sml --> ElabData/modules? (eventually a front-end version of kinds in ElabData/modules)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Basics (or "Library") or ?
  from Basics/util + Library/* ? 

prettyprint --> *  (delete, except for prettyprint/doc -> ?)
  replaced by smlnj-lib/PrettyPrint (except for prettyprint/doc)

pickle (from Library/pickle; relation with smlnj-lib/pickle?)
 this should eventually be replaced, probably by ASDL pickling

util/
  list3.sml               (like ListPair, but for triples)
  wordstr-hashtable.sml

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Admin (or ?)

  target.sig
  target32.sml
