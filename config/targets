# targets
#
# the following is a list of the targets (in addition to sml) that
# this shell script can install.  Comment out those that you do not
# want.  Note that cml-lib requires cml.
#
# The syntax of requests is as follows:
#
#    <file> ::= <req>*
#    <req>  ::= 'request' <module> NL
#            |  'if' SYMBOL NL <req>* <elif>* 'endif' NL
#    <elif> ::= 'elif' SYMBOL NL <req>*
#
# where NL represents end-of-line and SYMBOL is one of
#
#	SIZE_32		-- true for 32-bit systems
#	SIZE_64		-- true for 64-bit systems
#	WINDOWS		-- true for Microsoft Windows
#	UNIX		-- true for Unix systems (including macOS and Linux)

#
# The install script will move all libraries out of the source tree
# and into the $LIBDIR directory.  Thus, you can later delete the
# entire source tree without losing functionality.
# (Notice that the old "dont_move_libraries" directive broke a while ago
# and has been removed.)
#

# (The base system consisting of runtime, compiler, and basic libraries
# will always be built.)

# unpack the source code for everything (including for the SML/NJ compiler
# itself); this is not required,  unless you are doing compiler hacking,
# but it may be interesting to look at.
#
#request src-smlnj

# include backward-compatible versions of the Basis Library.

request old-basis

# build new (Unicode-capable) ML-ULex
#
request ml-ulex
#
# Arrange for the .lex suffix to be recognized by CM as (new-style)
# ML-ULex input.
#   (Notice that you should NOT select this option even if you want to have
#    ml-ulex process legacy ml-lex input using the --ml-lex-mode option.)
# Since most existing projects have legacy .lex files, this should be
# kept off by default.
# WARNING: This is incompatible with ml-lex-lex-ext!!
#request ml-ulex-lex-ext
#
# Register the "mllex" CM tool class in such a way that "legacy" ml-lex
# input is processed by "ml-ulex --ml-lex-mode".
#   (If you want the .lex extension to be mapped to the "mllex" class
#   and have that be processed by ml-ulex, you should request
#   ml-ulex-mllex-tool and ml-lex-lex-ext, but NOT ml-ulex-lex-ext.)

# kept on by default.
# WARNING: This is incompatible with ml-antlr-grm-ext!!
request ml-yacc-grm-ext

# Arrange for the .grm suffix to be recognized by CM as ML-Antlr input.

# a new foreign function interface (where "foreign" functions are
# "no longer foreign")
# This library is necessary to compile and/or run programs that use
# the new FFI.
# This preview release currently works under X86/Linux, Sparc/Solaris,

# NOTE: currently NLFFI is not supported on 64-bit machines

# Note: autoloading is always enabled.
#   In order to customize what is being pre-registered for autoloading
#   edit file "preloads".  You should make sure that it contains at least

#  Also, it is a good idea to have "$/basis.cm" pre-loaded.
