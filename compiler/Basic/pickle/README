Basic/pickle is a copy of Library/pickle.

TEMPORARY?
"These files should be replaced with equivalent versions from smlnj-lib or moved to smlnj-lib/Util."

[DBM: 2023.4.30]
Currently there is no "pickle" library in smlnj-lib.  Should these be turned into
a smlnj-lib library?

Also, what is the relation between these pickle-util.sml and unpickle-util.sml and the
pickler defined in ElabData/pickle?  Is there some redundancy?

The plan for the future is to replace the existig pickler code with pickling done through
ASDL, after which these files should become redundant.  This makes it doubtful that this
belongs in smlnj-lib, except perhaps that crc.sml might be put into smlnj-lib/Util.
