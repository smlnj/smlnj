  (* How to find the dynamic value corresponding to a variable.
   * -- LVAR is just a lambda-bound variable --- a "local" varialbe used to
   *    denote a binding in the current compilation unit.
   * -- EXTERN refers to a binding defined externally (in other modules).
   * -- PATH is an address relative a lambda-bound variable or external binding
   *    we find the value of the lambda-bound variable or external, and
   *    then do successive slot selects from that.
   *    PATH's are kept in reverse order.
   * -- NO_ACCESS is used to denote built-in structures that do not
   *    have corresponding dynamic objects (e.g., the built-in Inline is a
   *    structure that declares all the built-in primitives --- it is likely
   *    that NO_ACCESS will go away in the future once we have cleaned up the
   *    bootstrap procedure.

  (* How to decide the data representations for data constructors.
   * All true datatypes are divided into four categories, depending on the
   * pair of parameters (m,n) where m is the number of constant constructors
   * and n is the number of value carrying constructors. REF, EXN, SUSP
   * are special constructors for reference cells, exceptions, and suspensions;
   * treating them as data constructors simplifies the match compilation.
   * LISTCONS and LISTNIL are special conreps for unrolled lists. The process
   * of assigning conreps probably should be performed on the intermediate
   * language instead.
