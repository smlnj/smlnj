Code to represent real literals in the compiler.  This code is adapted from
the SML Compiler Utilities, which can be found at

	https://github.com/JohnReppy/sml-compiler-utils

The main change is that the "float" was changed to "real" in the naming scheme
so as to match the SML surface-language type.
