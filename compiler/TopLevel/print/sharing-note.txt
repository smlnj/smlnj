Example of "sharing" value printing

With !Control.Print.printLoop = true (the default):

  - datatype s = S of s option ref;

  - val y = S (ref NONE) : s

  - let val S z = y in z := SOME y end;

  - y;
  val it = S (ref (SOME (S %0))) as %0 : s


  - Control.Print.printLoop := false;
  - y;
  val it = S (ref (SOME (S (ref (SOME (S (ref (SOME (S #))))))))) : s


With printLoop false, recursion is cut off by printDepth.
