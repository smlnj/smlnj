(* back-trace.sml
 *
 *   A plug-in module for back-tracing.  This module hooks itself into
 *   the core environment so that tdp-instrumented code will invoke the
 *   provided functions "enter", "push", "save", and "report".
 *
 *   This module keeps track of the dynamic call-chain of instrumented modules.
 *   Non-tail calls are maintained in a stack-like fashion, and in addition
 *   to this the module will also track tail-calls so that a sequence of
 *   GOTO-like jumps from loop-cluster to loop-cluster can be shown.
 *
 *   This strategy, while certainly costly, has no more than constant-factor
 *   overhead in space and time and will keep tail-recursive code
 *   tail-recursive.
