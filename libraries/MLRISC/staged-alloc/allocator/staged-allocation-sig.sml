 * This code implements the Staged Allocation technique for calling conventions.
 * You can find the POPL06 paper describing this technique at

 *
 * Terminology for staged allocation (see the paper for more details):
 *   counter - stores of current the number of bits allocated to the call
 *   location - a mechanism for passing a parameter, e.g., machine registers, stack locations, etc.
 *   req - corresponds to a parameter
 *   alignment - alignment in bits for a location
 *   width - width in bits for a location
 *   stage - one rule for specifying calling conventions
