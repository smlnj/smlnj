Staged Allocation for MLRISC
Mike Rainey (mrainey@cs.uchicago.edu)

Staged allocation is a technique for handling calling conventions for different
architectures and languages. The basic idea is to use a domain-specific language
for calling conventions and an allocator machine. The allocator machine takes
a convention encoded in this language and a function signature and returns the
machine locations for passing and returning values. From there, it is trivial
to generate the calling sequence. For the full treatment, see the original
paper by Olinsky et. al.

Our library consists of two parts:
 * allocator - follows the operational semantics given in the paper
 * conventions - several calling conventions
