(*
 * This module is reponsible for generating garbage collection
 * code for all gc-points in the program.  That is, we delay the generation
 * of garbage collection code until all optimizations have been performed.
 * A callback is invoked at all GC safe-points with the appropriate type
 * information.  The callback is responsible for generating the appropriate
 * code to save and restore all roots and call the garbage collector.
