(* K&R2, A11.1, C names fall into four spaces. Same name may be used for different
 * purposes in the same scope if the uses are in different name spaces. These spaces
 * are: 1. Objects, functions, typedef names, and enum constants.
 *      2. Labels
 *      3. Tags of structures, unions, and enumerations
 *      4. Member of structures are unions individually.
 *
 * Member is (id * id), the first id is the id of the structure and the second is the
 * real member. Whenever you look up a Member, you must know the struct_ty. If you
 * know the struct_ty, you know the first id (see CTYPE), and then you can get a
 * unique mapping in the lookup.
