(* Note: in structure declarations, the bool is IsStruct/IsUnion, and the expression
 * after the declarator is the bit field.
 *)

(* Location Marking:
 * The expression, declarator, statement, declaration, and externalDecl
 * types have a MARK variant for annotating the corresponding constructs
 * with source file locations.
 *)

(* Syntax Extensions:
 * The operator, expression, specification, declarator, statement, declaration,
 * and externalDecl types have an ...Ext variant for supporting syntax
 * extensions.  The types of these variants, operatorExt, expressionExt, etc.
 * are defined by instantiating corresponding type operators defined in
 * the ParseTreeExt structure (see src/parser/extensions/c/parse-tree-ext*.sml
 * for the dummy definitions for ansi C).  In general, extensions for
 * a construct may need to build on other constructs, which is why
 * the ParseTreeExt type constructors are parameterized by the collection
 * of syntax tree types.
 *
 * A user-defined extension (call it x) would need it's own version of
 * ParseTreeExt defined in files parse-tree-ext-sig.sml and parse-tree-ext.sml
 * in a new directory src/parser/extensions/x/.
 *
