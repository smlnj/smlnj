 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Union/Find data type with ref-like interface.  A Union/Find structure
 * consists of a type constructor 'a uref with operations for
 * making an element of 'a uref (make), getting the contents of
 * an element (!!), checking for equality of two elements (equal), and
 * for joining two elements (union).  uref is analogous to ref as
 * expressed in the following table:
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 * type                  'a ref                'a uref
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 * introduction          ref                   uref
 * elimination           !                     !!
 * equality              =                     equal
 * updating              :=                    update
 * unioning                                    link, union, unify
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The main difference between 'a ref and 'a uref is in the union
 * operation.  Without union 'a ref and 'a uref can be used
 * interchangebly.  An assignment to a reference changes only the
 * contents of the reference, but not the reference itself.  In
 * particular, any two pointers that were different (in the sense of the
 * equality predicate = returning false) before an assignment will still
 * be so.  Their contents may or may not be equal after the assignment,
 * though.  In contrast, applying the union operations (link, union,
 * unify) to two uref elements makes the two elements themselves
 * equal (in the sense of the predicate equal returning true).  As a
 * consequence their contents will also be identical: in the case of link
 * and union it will be the contents of one of the two unioned elements,
 * in the case of unify the contents is determined by a binary
 * function parameter.  The link, union, and unify functions return true
 * when the elements were previously NOT equal.
