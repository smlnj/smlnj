<simpara>You should all have received an invitation to the course&#8217;s <ulink url="http://piazza.com">http://piazza.com</ulink> page
(if not, let us know ASAP).
If you have questions about homework, etc., please use piazza to post them.
Note that you should not post substantial bodies of code; either as part of a question
or as part of an answer.</simpara>

<section id="_text_book">
<title>Text book</title>
<simpara>The text for this course is <emphasis>How to Design Programs</emphasis> by Felleisen <emphasis>et al.</emphasis>
It is available online at <ulink url="http:\\htdp.org">http:\\htdp.org</ulink> or from the Seminary Coop Bookstore
on Woodlawn Ave.
Reading assignments will be posted on Piazza.</simpara>

<section id="_lectures">
<title>Lectures</title>
<simpara>I&#8217;ll try to start lectures on time; please try to be on time (and if not, enter from the back).
The lectures cover the material in the book, but from a different perspective.
You are responsible for the lecture material, so come to class.</simpara>
<simpara>Also, please turn off all of your devices during class (phones, laptops, tablets, glasses, etc.)</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_lab_sections">
<title>Lab sections</title>
<simpara>Labs are held in the new Computer Science Instructional Laboratory (CSIL) located
on the first floor of the Crerar Library.
There are four labs, but we will just use CSIL 1 (JCL 110) and CSIL 2 (JCL 111), which
are the Mac Labs.
More information about CSIL can be found at <ulink url="http://csil.cs.uchicago.edu">http://csil.cs.uchicago.edu</ulink>.</simpara>
<simpara>You can switch lab sections online by using the Registrar&#8217;s online "activity swap" system.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_programming_environment">
<title>Programming environment</title>
<simpara>We use the DrRacket development environment (version 5.3.6).
This system is installed on the Mac Lab machines (including the Linux boxes).
You can also download it from <ulink url="http://racket-lang.org">http://racket-lang.org</ulink>
for your personal machine.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_course_work">
<title>Course work</title>
<simpara>This course requires a lot of work.
For the most part, you will be asked to write many small programs.
Toward the end of the course, you will have an opportunity to write a more significant
program.</simpara>
<section id="_programming_assignments">
<title>Programming assignments</title>
<simpara>Assignments will be posted on the class web site.
There are three kinds of assignments:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
Lab assignments&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;    There will be short lab assignments that are due Thursday nights.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Homework&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;    There will be weekly homework assignments that will be due Monday nights.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Project&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;    There will be a multipart project assigned over the last few weeks of the course.
    The final part will be due during exam week.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>You will use subversion to submit your assignments (details on the web page).</simpara>
<simpara>Late assignments will <emphasis role="strong">not</emphasis> be accepted.
Since work is submitted electronically, deadlines are enforced to the minute.
Each student has one 24-hour extension on any lab or homework
assignment (except the first), no questions asked.  Note the 24-hour
extension may not be used on the first homework or lab exercise.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_exams">
<title>Exams</title>
<simpara>There will be two exams for all students (both sections) at the
following dates and times:</simpara>

<simpara>
Wednesday, October 30, 7pm&#8212;9pm, and

<section id="_course_introduction">
<title>Course Introduction</title>
<simpara>This course is called "Introduction to Computer Science", but, like most introductory CS courses,
it is largely about programming.</simpara>
<simpara>What is the relationship between this course and the field of CS?</simpara>
<simpara>Writing a program in a particular language is a concrete instance of the more general
idea of specifying a computational solution to a problem.</simpara>
<simpara>Not all problems are computationally solvable and many that are solvable cannot be
solved in a reasonable amount of time.</simpara>
<simpara>Programming serves many important roles in computer science:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
makes computational thinking concrete
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
realizes artifacts to test ideas (algorithms; novel systems; etc.)
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
motivates study of programming languages
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
discipline of software engineering
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</section>
<section id="_computers">
<title>Computers</title>
<simpara>Most (essentially all) general-purpose computers are instances of the <emphasis>von Neumann architecture</emphasis>,
which consists of a memory that holds both data and instructions coupled with a computational
processing unit (CPU).</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis>picture goes here</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Note that both data and code are represented as bits (0s and 1s) that are organized
in an addressable array of bytes (8-bit quantities).</simpara>
<simpara>How the bits are interpreted depends on the way that they are used.</simpara>
<simpara>This is a very powerful, but low-level model.</simpara>
<simpara>May discuss parallel architectures a bit at the end of the term.</simpara>
<simpara>Programming languages provide varying levels of abstraction from the details of the hardware.</simpara>
<simpara>Compilers translate programming languages into the bits needed to represent the executable program.</simpara>
<simpara>This abstraction is important for productivity (think algebra vs. arithmetic), portability, and our sanity.</simpara>
<simpara>There are many different languages that support many different models of programming (e.g., OO, FP, &#8230;).</simpara>
<simpara>While these languages look and feel different, they share a lot of common DNA;
<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis>, basic values (integers, booleans, &#8230;), conditionals, procedural abstraction,
and mechanisms for representing more complicated data.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_a_quick_introduction_to_the_command_line">
<title>A quick Introduction to the Command Line</title>
<simpara>File system; directories (<emphasis>aka</emphasis> folders).</simpara>
<simpara>Some basic commands: <emphasis role="strong">ls</emphasis>, <emphasis role="strong">pwd</emphasis>, <emphasis role="strong">cd</emphasis>, <emphasis role="strong">mkdir</emphasis>, <emphasis role="strong">cp</emphasis>, <emphasis role="strong">mv</emphasis>, <emphasis role="strong">touch</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>Use <emphasis role="strong">man</emphasis> to get information about a command.</simpara>
