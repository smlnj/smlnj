\chapter{Views}
\label{chap:views}

Views provide a general mechanism to customize the output of
\asdlgen{}.
Views allow description writers to annotate modules, types, and constructors
with directives or properties that are interpreted by \asdlgen{}.
Currently \asdlgen{} properties that allow for the following mechanisms are
supported:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Inclusion of arbitrary user code in the resulting output.
  \item
    Automatic coercion of specific types into more efficient user
    defined representations.
  \item
    Addition of extra user defined attributes and initialization code.
%  \item
%    Specialized user defined routines to read and write data structures to the
%    file system.
  \item
    Control over how the names of types, constructors, and modules names
    are mapped into the output language to resolve style issues and name space
    conflicts.
  \item
    Control over the tag values for sum types.
  \item
    Addition of documentation that describes the meaning of types
    constructors and modules.
\end{itemize}%

\section{Views and View Entities}

Currently, there are two views supported by \asdlgen{}: \texttt{cpp} for
when generating \Cplusplus{} code and \texttt{sml} for when generating Standard
ML code.

A \emph{view entity} specifies the scope to which a view entry is applied.
The entities are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    The \emph{file} entity, written ``\kw{<file>},'' which specifies
    the entire input file.
  \item
    A \emph{module} entity, written ``\kw{module} \cd{modid},''
    which specifies the module \cd{modid}.
  \item
    A \emph{type} entity, written ``\cd{modid}\kw{.}\cd{tyid},'' which
    specifies the type \cd{tyid} in the module \cd{modid}.
  \item
    A \emph{constructor} entity, written ``\cd{modid\kw{.}tyid\kw{.}conid},'' which
    specifies the constructor \cd{conid} that belongs to type \cd{tyid} in the module \cd{modid}.
    It is also possible to specify all of the constructors of a type by using the
    syntax ``\cd{modid\kw{.}tyid\kw{.*}}.''
\end{itemize}%

\section{View Entry Values}

See the chapter on \hyperref[chap:syntax]{Input Syntax} for details on
view the syntax and some basic view terminology.
The view syntax associates
an arbitrary string whose interpretation depends on the property it is
assigned too.
Currently there is a small set of standard interpretations.
%
\begin{description}
  \item[integer]
    An integral number in decimal notation.
  \item[string]
    A raw ASCII string.
  \item[boolean]
    A boolean value (either ``\lstinline!true!'' or ``\lstinline!false!'').
  \item[qualified identifier]
    A possibly qualified identifier (\eg{}, ``\lstinline!M.t!'' or ``\lstinline!t!'').
    Qualified identifiers are language independent
    identifiers that are translated to the appropriate output language in a
    uniform way.
    For example \lstinline!M.t! would appear as \lstinline!M::t! in C++ and as
    \lstinline!M.t! in \sml{}.
  \item[names]
    A non-empty list of comma-separated identifiers.
\end{description}%

In the discussion below, we specify the interpretation of the view-entry values,
the views that accept them, and the kinds of view entities that they may be applied to.

\newcommand{\PROP}[4]{%
  \item[\fbox{\texttt{#1}~~\normalfont\textit{#2}}]\hfill{\fbox{#3 / #4}}\\[0.25em] }

\subsection{Overriding the Default Names}
The view mechanism provides a fair amount of flexibility for overriding the
default names used for modules and functions in the generated code.

\begin{description}
  \PROP{file_pickler_name}{identifier}{\texttt{sml}}{Module}
    Specifies the name to give to the target module that implements file pickling.
    Does not apply to the \Cplusplus{} target, since memory and file pickling is
    combined.
  \PROP{memory_pickler_name}{identifier}{\texttt{sml}}{Module}
    Specifies the name to give to the target module that implements memory pickling.
    Does not apply to the \Cplusplus{} target, since memory and file pickling is
    combined.
  \PROP{name}{identifier}{All}{All}
    All entities have this property.  The value is interpreted as an identifier
    that overrides the name for the file, module, type, or data constructor
    in the output code.
  \PROP{pickler_name}{identifier}{\texttt{c++},\texttt{sml}}{Module}
    Specifies the name to give to the target module that implements both file
    and memory pickling.
    For the \sml{} view, this specifies the name of the pickler signature, but
    not the pickler structures, since different modules are generated
    for memory and file pickling.
  \PROP{sexp_pickler_name}{identifier}{\texttt{sml}}{Module}
    Specifies the name to give to the target module that implements S-Expression pickling.
\end{description}%

\subsection{Adding User Code}
It is useful to be able to add arbitrary user code to the modules
produced by \asdlgen{}.
Modules have six properties that can be set to allow
the addition of user-code to the generated modules.\footnote{
  In the case of a target language like \sml{}, where multiple modules
  are generated, the code is added to the base module that contains the
  generated type definitions.
}
\begin{description}
  \PROP{interface\char`\_prologue}{text}{\texttt{c++},\texttt{sml}}{File,Module}
    Include text verbatim after the introduction of the base
    environment, but before any type defined in the module interface.

  \PROP{interface\char`\_epilogue}{text}{\texttt{c++},\texttt{sml}}{File,Module}
    Include text verbatim after all types defined in the module
    interface have been defined.

  \PROP{implementation\char`\_prologue}{text}{\texttt{c++},\texttt{sml}}{File,Module}
    Include text verbatim after the introduction of the base
    environment, but before any other implementation code is defined.

  \PROP{implementation\char`\_epilogue}{text}{\texttt{c++},\texttt{sml}}{File,Module}
    Include text verbatim after all definitions defined in the module
    implementation.

%  \PROP{is\char`\_library}{bool}{\texttt{c++},\texttt{sml}}{Module}
%    Default value is false. If true assume all types can be used
%    as lists or options and generate any needed code, rather than ??

  \PROP{suppress}{names}{\texttt{c++},\texttt{sml}}{File,Module}
    Specifies which aspects of the generated code should be suppressed (\ie{},
    not generated).  The allowed names are:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \cd{types} --- suppresses the generation of the type definitions for the entity.
      \item \cd{pickler} --- suppresses the generation of the pickler code for the entity.
      \item \cd{unpickler} --- suppresses the generation of the unpickler code for the entity.
    \end{itemize}%
    It is also possible to specify ``\cd{none},'' which is the default and means
    that nothing is suppressed, and ``\cd{all},'' which means that all code generation
    for the entity is suppressed.
    It is often a good idea to first generate code and then
    set this entry, so that the generated code can be used as stubs for the
    user implementation.

  \PROP{private_code}{text}{\texttt{c++}}{Type,Con}
    Add the text to the class generated for the type or constructor with private scope.

  \PROP{protected_code}{text}{\texttt{c++}}{Type,Con}
    Add the text to the class generated for the type or constructor with protected scope.

  \PROP{public_code}{text}{\texttt{c++}}{Type,Con}
     Add the text to the class generated for the type or constructor with public scope.

\end{description}%

The precise meaning of interface and implementation for the different
target languages is as follows:
\begin{description}
  \item[\Cplusplus{}]
    The interface is the \texttt{.hpp} file and the implementation is the \texttt{.cpp}
    file.
    Code that is specified for the file entity will appear outside any namespace, whereas
    code that is specified for a module entity will appear inside the module's namespace.
  \item[\sml{}]
    The interface is the generated signature and the implementation is the structure.
    Code that is specified for the file entity will appear at top-most level, whereas code
    that is specified for a module entity will appear inside the corresponding signature
    or structure body.
\end{description}%

\subsection{Pickling Existing Types}

\asdlgen{} provides several mechanisms to support integrating existing
\sml{} types into an \asdl{} specification.
The first of these is to use a primitive module (see \secref{sec:primitive-syntax})
to define the representation of a type.
This approach has the disadvantage that the user must supply all of the
pickling and unpickling code for the type.

A second mechanism, which is only supported by the \sml{} view, for using existing types
in an \asdl{} specification is the \lstinline!is_datatype! property.
\begin{description}
  \PROP{is\char`\_datatype}{identifier}{\texttt{sml}}{Type}
    Specifies that the \asdl{} type should be defined using
    a datatype-replication declaration, where the identifier
    specifies the datatype being replicated.
\end{description}
For example, assume that we had an existing structure
%
\begin{code}\begin{lstlisting}[language=SML]
structure Color = struct
    datatype t = RED | GREEN | BLUE
  end
\end{lstlisting}\end{code}%
%
and that our \asdl{} specification contains the equivalent type declaration
%
\begin{code}\begin{lstlisting}[language=ASDL]
module ColorPkl {
  color = RED | GREEN | BLUE
}
view SML {
  ColorPkl.color <= is_datatype : Color.t
}
\end{lstlisting}\end{code}%
By including the \lstinline!is_datatype! property, the generated type
definitions will be
%
\begin{code}\begin{lstlisting}[language=SML]
structure ColorPkl = struct
    datatype color = datatype Color.t
  end
\end{lstlisting}\end{code}%
%
While the definition of the \lstinline!color! type is replicated, \asdlgen{} will still
generate the pickling and unpickling code for the type as it is defined in the \asdl{}
specification.

The third mechanism provides a way to translate between a program's internal representation
of a type and its \asdl{} representation.
For example, consider the following \asdl{} specification for finite maps between
integers:
%
\begin{code}\begin{lstlisting}[language=ASDL]
module IntMap {
  int_map = (int size, entries map)
  entries = (entry* entries)
  entry   = (int key, int value)
  map_pair = (int_map, int_map)
}
\end{lstlisting}\end{code}%
%
is one possible abstract description of a mapping from integers to
integers.
Such an implementation is not particularly efficient; we might prefer to
use binary-search trees for more efficient lookups.
We can easily describe such a data structure in \asdl{}
\begin{code}\begin{lstlisting}[language=ASDL]
module IntMap {
  int_map = (size int, map tree)
  tree = Node(int key, int value, tree left, tree right)
       | Empty
  map_pair = (int_map, int_map)
}
\end{lstlisting}\end{code}%
but this description exposes implementation details and prevents the use
of existing library code.  Furthermore, changing the representation
to use a hash table would require that all clients be changed.

\asdlgen{} supports four properties -- \lstinline!natural_type!,
\lstinline!natural_type_con!, \lstinline!wrapper!, and \lstinline!unwrapper! --
to allow clients to use a specialized representation for ASDL types.\footnote{
  Primitive modules are another way to solve this problem, but they require
  all of the pickling and unpickling code be provided by the user.
}
\begin{description}
  \PROP{natural\char`\_type}{identifier}{\texttt{c++},\texttt{sml}}{Type}
    Specifies the type to use in place of the original type in all of the
    generated code.
    Supported by all output languages.

  \PROP{natural\char`\_type\char`\_con}{identifier}{\texttt{c++},\texttt{sml}}{Type}
    A unary type constructor to apply to the old type to get a new type to
    use in all the resulting code; \eg{}, \lstinline@ref@ in \sml{} to make a type
    mutable.
    \emph{Support for \Cplusplus{} templates will be added in the near future.}

  \PROP{wrapper}{identifier}{\texttt{c++},\texttt{sml}}{Type}
    Specifies the name of the function to convert the pickle type to the natural
    type when reading the pickle.  The interface code for this function will
    be generated, but the implementation must be provided using the
    \lstinline@implementation_prologue@ or \lstinline@implementation_epilogue@
    properties.

  \PROP{unwrapper}{identifier}{\texttt{c++},\texttt{sml}}{Type}
    Specifies the name of the function to convert the natural type to the pickle
    type when writing the pickle.  The interface code for this function will
    be generated, but the implementation must be provided using the
    \lstinline@implementation_prologue@ or \lstinline@implementation_epilogue@
    properties.
\end{description}%

When using \lstinline!natural_type! and \lstinline!natural_type_con!,
the automatically generated type definitions for the original type still
remain, but all other references to the original type in constructors, picklers,
and other type definitions that referred to it are replaced with the new type.
The original definition must remain to support pickling of the type. Pickling
is achieved by appropriately coercing the new type to the old type and vice
versa with functions specified by \lstinline!wrapper! and \lstinline!unwrapper!
properties.

For example, we can use the \smlnj{} Library's \lstinline@IntRedBlackMap@ structure
to implement the \lstinline!int_map! type by adding the following view declaration
for the \lstinline!IntMap! module:
%
\begin{code}\begin{lstlisting}[language=ASDL]
view sml {
  module IntMap <= {
    interface_prologue : type int_map = int IntRedBlackMap.map
    implementation_prologue
%%
    structure IntMap = IntRedBlackMap
    type int_map = int IntMap.map
%%
    implementation_epilogue
%%
    fun wrap_int_map ({map={entries}, ...} : int_map_pkl) =
          List.foldl IntMap.insert' IntMap.empty entries
    fun unwrap_int_map (imap : int_map) = {
            size = IntMap.numItems imap,
            map = {entries = IntMap.foldri
              (fn (k, v, ents) => {key = k, value = v} :: ents)
                []
                  imap}
          }
%%
  }
  IntMap.int_map <= {
    name : int_map_pkl
    natural_type : int_map
    wrapper : wrap_int_map
    unwrapper : unwrap_int_map
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}\end{code}%
%
In this view, we rename \lstinline@int_map@ to \lstinline@int_map_pkl@ and add a type
definition for \lstinline!int_map! to both the interface
(signature) and implementation (structure).
We also add definitions of the wrapper and unwrapper functions.
The generated code is
\begin{code}\begin{lstlisting}[language=SML]
structure IntMap : sig
    type int_map = int IntRedBlackMap.map
    type entry = {key : int, value : int}
    type entries = {entries : entry list}
    type int_map_pkl = {size : int, map : entries}
    type map_pair = int_map * int_map
    val wrap_int_map : int_map_pkl -> int_map
    val unwrap_int_map : int_map -> int_map_pkl
  end = struct
    structure IntMap = IntRedBlackMap
    type int_map = int IntMap.map
    type entry = {key : int, value : int}
    type entries = {entries : entry list}
    type int_map_pkl = {size : int, map : entries}
    type map_pair = int_map * int_map
    fun wrap_int_map ({map={entries}, ...} : int_map_pkl) = ...
    fun unwrap_int_map (imap : int_map) = ...
  end
\end{lstlisting}\end{code}%
Note that we had to define the \lstinline[language=SML]@int_map@ type in
the prologue so that the definition of the \lstinline[language=SML]@int_map@
type was well-defined.

\subsection{Pickling Existing SML Datatypes}

Because ASDL types have a direct correspondence with SML types, it is often
the case that an existing SML type in your code is identical to what
ASDL would generate for a given specification.
In such a case, we can suppress the generation of the type definitions
for the module using the ``\lstinline@suppress types@'' view entity
for the module in question.
\asdlgen{} will still generate the pickler modules, but not the type
definitions.

\subsection{Target-Specific Properties}

\subsubsection{\Cplusplus{} Properties}
The following properties are only valid for the \Cplusplus{} view.
\begin{description}
  \PROP{arena_alloc}{boolean}{\texttt{c++}}{File}
    Setting this property to \texttt{true} will enable use of an arena allocator
    when unpickling a value~\cite{arena-alloc}.
\end{description}%

\subsection{Other Properties}
\begin{description}
  \PROP{doc\char`\_string}{text}{any}{any}
    All entities have this property. Its value is interpreted as a
    string. Currently only the \lstinline!--doc! command recognizes the
    property. It includes the property value in the HTML documentation
    produced for the module.

  \PROP{user\char`\_attribute}{identifier}{c++}{Type}
    Property of types only.	The value is interpreted as a qualified
    identifier. Add a field called \lstinline!client_data! as an
    attribute to the type. The value is the qualified identifier that
    represents an arbitrary user type of the field. The \lstinline!client_data!
    field is ignored by the pickling code and does not appear in
    constructors. This property is currently only recognized when
    outputting \Cplusplus{}.

%  \PROP{user\char`\_init}{identifier}{}{}
%    Property of types only. The value is interpreted as a qualified
%    identifier. Call the function specified by the value before
%    returning the data structure created by a constructor function.
%    This property is currently only recognized when outputting C.

  \PROP{base\char`\_class}{identifier}{c++}{Type}
    Property of types only. The value is interpreted as a qualified
    identifier. The name of the class from which all classes generated
    for that type should inherit from.

  \PROP{reader}{identifier}{\texttt{c++},\texttt{sml}}{Type}
   Property of types only. The value is interpreted as a qualified
   identifier.  Replace the body of the read pickle function for this
   type with a call to a function with the proper arguments.

  \PROP{writer}{identifier}{\texttt{c++},\texttt{sml}}{Type}
   Property of types only. The value is interpreted as a qualified
   identifier.  Replace the body of the writer pickle function for this
   type with a call to a function with the proper arguments.

  \PROP{enum\char`\_value}{integer}{\texttt{c++}}{Con}
   Property of constructors only.
   Use this integer value as the \emph{internal} tag value for the
   constructor. The external pickle tag remains unchanged.

\end{description}%
