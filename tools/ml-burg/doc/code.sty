% code.sty: -*- latex -*-
% Latex macros for a "weak" verbatim mode.
% -- like verbatim, except \, {, and } have their usual meanings.

% Environments: code, tightcode,  codeaux, codebox, centercode
% Commands: \dcd, \cddollar, \cdmath, \cd, \codeallowbreaks, \codeskip, \^
% Already defined in LaTeX, but of some relevance: \#, \$, \%, \&, \_, \{, \}

% Changelog at the end of the file.

% These commands give you an environment, code, that is like verbatim
% except that you can still insert commands in the middle of the environment:
%     \begin{code}
%     for(x=1; x<loop_bound; x++)
%         y += x^3; /* {\em Add in {\tt x} cubed} */
%     \end{code}
%
% All characters are ordinary except \{}. To get \{} in your text, 
% you use the commands \\, \{, and \}.

% These macros mess with the definition of the special chars (e.g., ^_~%).
% The characters \{} are left alone, so you can still have embedded commands:
%	\begin{code} f(a,b,\ldots,y,z) \end{code}
% However, if your embedded commands use the formerly-special chars, as in
%    	\begin{code} x := x+1 /* \mbox{\em This is $y^3$} */ \end{code}
% then you lose. The $ and ^ chars are scanned in as non-specials,
% so they don't work. If the chars are scanned *outside* the code env,
% then you have no problem:
% 	\def\ycube{$y^3$}
% 	\begin{code} x := x+1 /* {\em This is \ycube} */ \end{code}
% If you must put special chars inside the code env, you do it by
% prefixing them with the special \dcd ("decode") command, that
% reverts the chars to back to special status:
%    	\begin{code} x := x+1 /* {\dcd\em This is $y^3$} */ \end{code}
% \dcd's scope is bounded by its enclosing braces. It is only defined within
% the code env. You can also turn on just $ with the \cddollar command;
% you can turn on just $^_ with the \cdmath command. See below.
%
% Alternatively, just use \(...\) for $...$, \sp for ^, and \sb for _.

% WARNING:
% Like \verb, you cannot put a \cd{...} inside an argument to a macro
% or a command. If you try, for example,
%     \mbox{\cd{$x^y$}}
% you will lose. That is because the text "\cd{$x^y$}" gets read in
% as \mbox's argument before the \cd executes. But the \cd has to
% have a chance to run before LaTeX ever reads the $x^y$ so it can
% turn off the specialness of $ and ^. So, \cd has to appear at
% top level, not inside an argument. Similarly, you can't have
% a \cd or a \code inside a macro (Although you could use \gdef to
% define a macro *inside* a \cd, which you could then use outside.
% Don't worry about this if you don't understand it.)

% BUG: In the codebox env, the effect of a \dcd, \cddollar, or \cdmath
%   command is reset at the end of each line. This can be hacked by
%   messing with the \halign's preamble, if you feel up to it.

% Useage note: the initial newline after the \begin{code} or 
%   \begin{codebox} is eaten, but the last newline is not.
%   So,
%     \begin{code}
%     foo
%     bar
%     \end{code}
%  leaves one more blank line after bar than does
%     \begin{code}
%     foo
%     bar\end{code}
%  Moral: get in the habit of terminating code envs without a newline
%  (as in the second example).

% =============================================================================

% Set up code environment, in which most of the common special characters
% appearing in code are treated verbatim, namely: $&#^_~%
% \ { } are still enabled so that macros can be called in this
% environment.  Use \\, \{, and \} to use these characters verbatim
% in this environment.
% 
% Inside a group, you can make
% all the hacked chars	special with the	\dcd		command
% $			special with the 	\cddollar	command
% $^_			special with the	\cdmath		command.
% If you have a bunch of math $..$'s in your code env, then a global \cddollar
% or \cdmath at the beginning of the env can save a lot of trouble.
% When chars are special (e.g., after a \dcd), you can still get #$%&_{} with
% \#, \$, \%, \&, \_, \{, and \} -- this is standard LaTeX.
% Additionally, \\ gives \ inside the code env, and when \cdmath
% makes ^ special, it also defines \^ to give ^.

%The hacked characters can be made special again
% within a group by using the \dcd command.

% Note: this environment allows no breaking of lines whatsoever; not
% at spaces or hypens.  To arrange for a break use the standard \- command,
% or a \discretionary{}{}{} which breaks, but inserts nothing.  This is useful,
% for example for allowing hypenated identifiers to be broken, e.g.
% \def\={\discretionary{}{}{}} %optional break
% FOO-\=BAR.

%% codebox, centerbox
%%=============================================================================
%% The codebox env makes a box exactly as wide as it needs to be
%% (i.e., as wide as the longest line of code is). This is useful
%% if you want to center a chunk of code, or flush it right, or
%% something like that. The optional argument to the environment,
%% [t], [c], or [b], specifies how to vertically align the codebox,
%% just as with arrays or other boxes. Default is [c].

%% Must be a newline immediately after "\begin{codebox}[t]"!

{\catcode`\^^M=\active % these lines must end with %
  \gdef\cd@obeycr{\catcode`\^^M=\active\let^^M=\cr}}

% If there is a [<letter>] option, then the following newline will
% be read *after* ^M is bound to \cr, so we're cool. If there isn't
% an option given (i.e., default to [c]), then the @\ifnextchar will
% gobble up the newline as it gobbles whitespace. So we insert the
% \cr explicitly. Isn't TeX fun?
\def\codebox{\leavevmode\@ifnextchar[{\@codebox}{\@codebox[c]\cr}} %]

\def\@codebox[#1]%

%% code, codeaux, tightcode
%%=============================================================================
%% Code environment as described above. Lines are kept on one page.
%% This actually works by setting a huge penalty for breaking
%% between lines of code. Code is indented same as other displayed paras.
%% Note: to increase left margin, use \begin{codeaux}{\leftmargin=1in}.

% To allow pagebreaks, say \codeallowbreaks immediately inside the env.
% You can allow breaks at specific lines with a \pagebreak form.

%% N.B.: The \global\@ignoretrue command must be performed just inside
%% the *last* \end{...} before the following text. If not, you will
%% get an extra space on the following line. Blech.

%% This environment takes two arguments. 
%% The second, required argument is the \list parameters to override the
%%     \@listi... defaults.
%%     - Usefully set by clients: \topsep \leftmargin
%%     - Possible, but less useful: \partopsep
%% The first, optional argument is the extra \parskip glue that you get around
%%     \list environments. It defaults to the value of \parskip.
\def\codeaux{\@ifnextchar[{\@codeaux}{\@codeaux[\parskip]}} %]

% Change log:
% Started off as some macros found in C. Rich's library.
% Olin 1/90:
% Removed \makeatletter, \makeatother's -- they shouldn't be there,
%   because style option files are read with makeatletter. The terminal
%   makeatother screwed things up for the following style options.
% Olin 3/91:
% Rewritten. 
% - Changed things so blank lines don't get compressed out (the \leavevmove
%   in \cd@cr and \cd@crwb). 
% - Changed names to somewhat less horrible choices. 
% - Added lots of doc, so casual hackers can more easily mess with all this.
% - Removed `'"@ from the set of hacked chars, since they are already
%   non-special. 
% - Removed the bigcode env, which effect can be had with the \codeallowbreaks
%   command.
% - Removed the \@noligs command, since it's already defined in latex.tex.
% - Win big with the new \dcd, \cddollar, and \cdmath commands.
% - Now, *only* the chars \{} are special inside the code env. If you need
%   more, use the \dcd command inside a group.
% - \cd now works inside math mode. (But if you use it in a superscript,
%   it still comes out full size. You must explicitly put a \scriptsize\tt
%   inside the \cd: $x^{\cd{\scriptsize\tt...}}$. A \leavevmode was added
%   so that if you begin a paragraph with a \cd{...}, TeX realises you
%   are starting a paragraph.
% - Added the codebox env. Tricky bit involving the first line hacked
%   with help from David Long.
%
% JHR 8/19/91:
% - Added \setupsmallcode to use in multi-line code displays (code, codeaux and
%   codebox environments).
%
% JHR 8/31/91:
% - changed size of small code to \small (from \footnotesize).  Also added
%   code to set the baselinestretch to 1 in smallcode.
%
% JHR 9/12/91:
% - added \codeindent (set to \parindent)
%
% JHR 11/19/91
% - added \cdm{} command for supporting math mode in \cd{}
