Installation instructions for ML-Burg
-------------------------------------

ML-Burg can be automatically
installed as part of the SML/NJ system
by the SML/NJ installer.

To install by hand (e.g., if you make
your own modifications), run the

    ./build

script in this directory and then move
the file

    ml-burg.$ARCH-$OS

to the heap-file directory.  Also,
make sure that you have a symbolic
link from "ml-burg" to ".run-sml"
in the bin directory.

Running ./build requires a properly
functioning installation of SML/NJ,
including ml-lex and ml-yacc.
