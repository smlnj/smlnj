Installation instructions for ML-Burg
-------------------------------------

ML-Burg can be automatically installed as part of the SML/NJ
system by the SML/NJ installer.

To install by hand (e.g., if you make your own
modifications), run the

    ./build.sh

script in this directory and then move the file

    ml-burg.$ARCH-$OS

to the heap-file directory bin/.heap.  Also, make sure that
you have a symbolic link from "ml-burg" to ".run-sml" in the
bin directory.

Running ./build.sh requires a properly functioning installation
of SML/NJ, including ml-lex and ml-yacc.
